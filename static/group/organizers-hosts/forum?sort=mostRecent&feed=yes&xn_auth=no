&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m preparing the Coderetreat day in Alicante. I&#039;m having problems finding local sponsor for that day. In case that I don&#039;t manage to find one, we&#039;ll have to go to a restaurant to have lunch. It&#039;s not bad at all but I&#039;ve watched other coderetreats and It would be great that I could bring the lunch and invite the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestion of company that I could contact to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Expect people to arrive late, and plan in buffer time for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Ensure that everyone lets you know if they are bringing a laptop or not - that way you can plan to have enough (and they must be already set up to program in the language of choice and with relevant test framework). Remember that they work in pairs so you only need enough for half the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Give attendees graph paper - they will want to draw out notes for the Game of Life, graph paper makes this easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Don&#039;t forget small things like name badges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Make big prints of the 4 rules for the Game of Life and stick them up in the work area, these are often referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Make sure you have at least a 45min to break over lunch time, more is better! The mind needs to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Get feedback from everyone, it can only make future events better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Enjoy, the day will fly past :)&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>

                        &lt;p&gt;How have you showcased a twitter feed for the coderetreats you&#039;ve hosted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;d be nice to have a projector showing the #coderetreat feed, and while I assume there are better options than manually refreshing Twitter&#039;s search page, I don&#039;t know what they are. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                        &lt;p&gt;[Update: Jim had a great idea for a name, so we renamed this to Coderetreat Live]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve had ideas around an application that would help coordinate same-day coderetreats in different locations. This is a great idea, and I thought I&#039;d start a discussion for adding features. I&#039;m working on having something available for the 2011 global day event, and we can continue to add features over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian Mowat wrote a blog post &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://coderetreat.ning.com/profiles/blogs/an-idea&quot;&gt;about this with some ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the main feature would be to have a page that anyone could view which shows the following information about the coderetreats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have they started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which session are they on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the exercise, constraints, etc. for the current session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the necessary functionality will be added to support updating this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual event pages that can be used at the event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having the app include a timer for the session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to open up the discussion to other feature ideas. We won&#039;t be able to get eveything done in time for global day, but we can certainly begin working. Over time, we could have something great that future coderetreats can use when they have several on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve started a github repo for this, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/coreyhaines/coderetreat-live&quot;&gt;coderetreat-live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
