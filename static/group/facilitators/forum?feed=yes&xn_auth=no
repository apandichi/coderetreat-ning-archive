&lt;p&gt;Doing a Google hangout with another GDCR event in a faraway time zone helps to bring home the GLOBAL nature of the event to attendees. I&#039;ve used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cross-timezone meeting planner&lt;/a&gt; to determine times that work and have tentatively sent out invites to others for two hangouts; one just before our local lunchtime and another at our end-of-day retrospective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the idea, it&#039;s not rocket science. You need to remain flexible, make sure you agree on the way to communicate &lt;em&gt;beforehand,&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;make sure&lt;/em&gt; to pay attention to the time to make it happen. It may even help to ask someone other that the event facilitator to do that. It&#039;s easy for a facilitator to have so many things going on that they miss the planned window. Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our most recent Rochester Ruby meeting, I facilitated a mini coderetreat.  My grand plan was to get a feel for the job before the day of #gdcr13.  Luckily for me, I had just taken Jim Hurne&#039;s excellent training and I felt like I was prepared with plans and printouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not terribly surprised to discover that my initial planning was a waste of time.  During Jim&#039;s training, he was very clear that carrying some index cards and making notes while you observe is helpful.…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                            &lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our most recent Rochester Ruby meeting, I facilitated a mini coderetreat.  My grand plan was to get a feel for the job before the day of #gdcr13.  Luckily for me, I had just taken Jim Hurne&#039;s excellent training and I felt like I was prepared with plans and printouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not terribly surprised to discover that my initial planning was a waste of time.  During Jim&#039;s training, he was very clear that carrying some index cards and making notes while you observe is helpful.  At the meeting, we had time for 2 sessions, and I was completely blown away.  The process of observation during the session was just amazing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#039;t until I was looking at their code, listening to them talk things through, and then watch the little successes and failures unfold that I started to get it.  It wasn&#039;t until after everything that I understood how that makes me a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the attendees were new to OO, or eschewed OO, or thought they were grand masters but didn&#039;t seem to get OO at all.  They didn&#039;t write a lot of code, and TDD was some kind of kryptonite hipster mountain they didn&#039;t want to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2nd session, we tried basic ping-pong.  One team (out of 3) was having a really hard time.  Nothing I said about &quot;why TDD?&quot; helped at all, until we talked a little bit about why OO.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really focused on just asking questions as the only way to coach.  It wasn&#039;t until I had to explain OO that I broke out of that, and I sat down with them to do it.  It seemed to help.  By the end of the session they had red -&amp;gt; greened their first tests of the night, probably ever.  They at least acted like they were pretty happy about it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really looking forward to 12/14, hopefully with more surprises!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re going to organize first code retreat in our company and we&#039;re wondering what to do with GUI. The problem is that most of our engineers aren&#039;t GUI guys. We usually write client-server applications without GUI, but it seems that GUI is something important for the &quot;Game of Life&quot;.

                        &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m one of facilitators/organizers of Coderetreat events in Czech Republic. For some time I have been playing with an idea of adding little bit of gamification into Coderetreat events. Idea is pretty simple - each participant will get short checklist at the beginning of the event. Checklist will contain list of activities which he might try to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checklist might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pair with stranger…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pair with stranger&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐☐☐☐☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Delete code after session&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐☐☐☐☐☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cover most of the code by tests&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Make all methods less than 4 lines&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Write tests first (before production code)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Don&#039;t touch mouse&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Switch navigator/driver role during session&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;check&quot;&gt;☐&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row full of checked checkboxes he will get 1 point. But it wouldn&#039;t be used to compete with others. It&#039;s just for his personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice and short overview of things one might try to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gentle reminder of things one shall do in/after each session (delete code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#039;s easy to compare driver/navigator cards before session so they can choose what to try next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might even be a nice commemorative item from Coderetreat event (pair partners might even sign each other&#039;s card on back side :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML version I&#039;m going to use to print cards for upcoming GDCR event in Prague, Czech Republic - &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.maio.cz/checklist/checklist.html&quot;&gt;http://coderetreat.maio.cz/checklist/checklist.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta version of real card &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.coderetreat.cz/albums/misc&quot;&gt;http://photos.coderetreat.cz/albums/misc&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is github repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maio/coderetreat-checklist&quot;&gt;https://github.com/maio/coderetreat-checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it sound like good/bad thing to do at Coderetreat? I would appreciate any feedback. After event I&#039;ll share our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
