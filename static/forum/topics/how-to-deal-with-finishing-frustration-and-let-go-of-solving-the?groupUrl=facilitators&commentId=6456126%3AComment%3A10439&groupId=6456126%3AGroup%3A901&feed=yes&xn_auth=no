&lt;p&gt;Since it was during work-hours, I feel some of the participants - from whom those complaints came from - were not completely freely joining the party ; that could be part of the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 sessions sure isn&#039;t enough, but most of the participants already picked up the ball after the first round. They got the idea and played along really well. I might have had a large numbers of &quot;early adopters&quot; in the group which led me into thinking it was understood by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the constraints part, we mostly focused on getting everybody onboard with TDD and then on expressing intent. I guess I was not poking around hard enough so that their focus would shift from the problem to the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for your feedback, I&#039;m looking forward to our next session!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t an uncommon response. There are two things I think cause this. Although I don&#039;t know if these are your reasons, they definitely are ones that can come up. Perhaps some other experience facilitators can chime in, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Having too few sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 sessions isn&#039;t enough, especially if this is the first time. The day of coderetreat builds itself up over the 5-6 sessions. Each session builds upon the previous sessions, so that, by the end of the day,…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;p&gt;- Having too few sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 sessions isn&#039;t enough, especially if this is the first time. The day of coderetreat builds itself up over the 5-6 sessions. Each session builds upon the previous sessions, so that, by the end of the day, the &#039;frustration&#039; people feel doesn&#039;t take on a negative bent, but rather a desire to continue thinking about it. This is one of the reasons that I&#039;m not a support of &quot;mini-coderetreat&quot; as a large group activity, especially for people who are experiencing it for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Not introducing different constraints for each session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of variation did you provide for each session? As developers, we have spent our careers focused on &#039;getting things done&#039; and &#039;going faster,&#039; so it is difficult to break out of this mentality. By introducing different constraints, each session takes on a different feel. Over the course of the day, the problem is approached in a different manner. This creates something that can be focused on during each session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tough for people to just focus on an abstract idea of &quot;the code and its beauty.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
