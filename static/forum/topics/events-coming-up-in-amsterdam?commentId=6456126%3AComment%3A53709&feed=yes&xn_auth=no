                        &lt;p&gt;On October 22nd there is a new Global Day of Code Retreat. Amsterdam is not among the venues organizing their own edition. I could contact Rockstart in Amsterdam to see if they have space available in October. Could you help me organize a day in Amsterdam in October ?&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

                        &lt;p&gt;After taking part for 3 times, I believe that a way to make it interesting and challenging for myself is to organize own coderetreat. This way you can add more games, set your own rules. Facilitator has even more learnings from the practice.&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>
