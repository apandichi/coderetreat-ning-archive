&lt;p&gt;it is indeed very basic. That is deliberate. Features like resharper are a good way of going faster when you are creating software with the intention of shipping it. But in a practice session you are not creating software with the intention of shipping it! So what is the purpose? To practice! To learn. And by learn I mean something very specific. I mean changing your behaviour. If you do a practice and afterwards you all work in exactly the same way as before then the…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

But in a practice session you are not creating software with the intention of shipping it! So what is the purpose? To practice! To learn. And by learn I mean something very specific. I mean changing your behaviour. If you do a practice and afterwards you all work in exactly the same way as before then the practice was a waste of time. To a great degree, the more you are &quot;provoked&quot; during a practice the better. There is no learning without provocation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;You suggest you&#039;d like each pair to be able to pick their own language. That they would find this more &quot;comfortable&quot;. So that is exactly what they are _not_ allowed to do! Thus they are &quot;forced&quot;, in a safe, obviously non-development environment, to face their underlying fears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;I find the best sessions are where there is definite tension in the room. Palpable energy. Switching partners during a practice session, for example, is something I find a lot of developers initially &quot;resist&quot;. Their resistance is a sure sign it will be beneficial! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;Hope this helps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve seen several times a java developer used to eclipse, pairing with a ruby developer used to textmate, and they struggle to pair program effectively, whichever of their two languages and environments they choose.

For them, cyber-dojo lets them both be equally out of their comfort zone, and it leads to better pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d have to use it more, but I think it would make people more likely to pair with people outside of their language/editor preference, and spread knowledge. I havn&#039;t been measuring, but I have a feeling the pairs in my code retreats havn&#039;t mixed and switched enough. I&#039;m less interested in a few good Ruby programmers exchanging Vim tricks than the whole group getting better at pairing and TDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still on the fence as to whether or not to encourage the use of cyber-dojo.  It sounds like it did help pairs focus on their coding technique and it definitely provided valuable information to the facilitator and the pairs about how well the pair was applying TDD. It is also clear using cyber-dojo eliminated a lot of setup-related issues. This is certainly all good.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also clear using cyber-dojo eliminated a lot of setup-related issues. This is certainly all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a coderetreat that uses everyday tools (which is the common case today), I often observe developers learning a lot from each other about their tools. For example, it is not uncommon for a developer to learn some new tricks in Vim or Emacs that they didn&#039;t know before (it also not uncommon for a developer to see Vim or Emacs used to its fullest potential for the first time).  These are good, practical leanings that can help developers to become more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what it comes down to is what you want participants to get out of the coderetreat. If you want them to focus exclusively on the code and on TDD, then using cyber-dojo sounds like an excellent choice. If you also want to give developers the opportunity to learn ways of working more productively, then using everyday tools might be a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there isn&#039;t a clear &quot;right choice,&quot; I&#039;m might try alternating coderetreats between cyber-dojo and everyday tools, or asking participants to use cyber-dojo for a portion (possibily half) of a coderetreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for sharing! It was definitely a valuable experiment that I hope others will repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
