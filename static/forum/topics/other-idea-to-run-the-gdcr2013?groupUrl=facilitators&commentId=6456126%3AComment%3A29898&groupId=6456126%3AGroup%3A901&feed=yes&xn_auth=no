&lt;p&gt;The important question you should ask is: &#039;What is the goal/outcome of the the event?&#039;  A hackathon can be an amazing event, but it has a different goal  (and drives different behavior) than code retreat.  In particular, everyone being under time pressure to deliver functioning apps and each group working in a different problem domain tends to reduce opportunities for shared learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Conway&#039;s being &#039;solved&#039;: Code Retreat has used GOL for four years, and many have raised similar questions. I&#039;ll refer you to this Stack Exchange thread:&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;I think the point of CR is to teach how to practice by doing it. To do that, to practice, the problem you are trying to solve must disappear. The problem it&#039;s an excuse to practice one or more of the programming core skills. That&#039;s why we always use the same problem, that&#039;s why we delete our code at the end of each session.

As long as you keep the focus on learning how to practice I don&#039;t see a real problem. Only one advice, if you want/need to change the problem don&#039;t choose a &quot;too interesting&quot; problem :-) The GOL is well tuned because it&#039;s interesting/challenging enough to not be boring, but it&#039;s boring enough to let the attendees to focus on practicing :-)&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
