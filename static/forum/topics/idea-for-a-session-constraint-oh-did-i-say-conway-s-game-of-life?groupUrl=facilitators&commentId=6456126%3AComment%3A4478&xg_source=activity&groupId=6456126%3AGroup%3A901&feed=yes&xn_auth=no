Bringing in a change in the world (dimensions, bounding) is apt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have brought up changes in the states with some groups, usually in the afternoon. So, perhaps a cell has a certain amount of energy that ticks away as long as it is alive, eventually dying when it hits zero. Or,…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that this would help to show how to remove the primitive obsession around the boolean of dead and alive, as it gets tricky to show three states with a single boolean.  But if you had a CellState base type for AliveState and DeadState, it would likely be straight forward to introduce a third. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad to hear you got a chance to facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often will stop the group with 5 minutes to spare and tell them that I made a mistake, it is actually a 3d grid, bounded on one side. I&#039;ll then ask them to spend the 5 minutes discussing their design and how much it would cost to change to the new requirement. I emphasize that it isn&#039;t about supporting both, but rather moving to the new, better understood requirements. It is a great thing to do if you happen to see that a lot of teams are letting the topology leak through their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great insight!&lt;/p&gt;
