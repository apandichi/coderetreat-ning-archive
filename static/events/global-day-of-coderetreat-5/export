 's how it works: SW developers of all sorts gather together with their
  machines and IDE's ready to code Conway's Game of Life for 45 minute 
 sessions. Pairs change with every 45 minute iteration so everyone gets
  exposed to different problem solving strategies, and everyone learns 
 together:  newbies and master-craft persons alike. There is no expect
 ation to finish coding Conway's Game of Life at any point during the d
 ay. \nThe purpose is to learn coding problem solving strategies, shar
 e skills and experience pairing in a supportive environment. \nPDXWIT
  a community-based non-profit organization with the purpose of strengt
 hening the Portland women in tech community through educational progra
 ms, partnerships and events that provide information, connections, res
 ources, opportunities, and a supportive environment for current and po
 tential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other
 . Our goal is to bring together and empower current women in tech and 
 encourage others to pursue tech careers to help reduce gender imbalanc
 e in the industry and address the current negative effects of that imb
 alance on women.\n\nFor more information visit http://coderetreat.org/
