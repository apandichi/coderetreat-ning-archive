SUMMARY:Coderetreat Riga
DESCRIPTION:It is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on th
 e fundamentals of software development and design. By providing develo
 pers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the p
 ressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven i
 tself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing 
 the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers
  can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of ch
 ange over time. More:Â http://coderetreat.org/about\nLast time (http:/
 /www.agile-latvia.org/events/63792502/) some went all the way through 
 'TDD as if you meant it' and 'Object calisthenics' and were quite happ
 y. This time we will do a classic coderetreat again, just choosing ano
 ther problem to attack.\n\nFor more information visit http://coderetre
