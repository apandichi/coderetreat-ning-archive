SUMMARY:Legacy Coderetreat Rotterdam 2012-6-23
DESCRIPTION:After last years participation in the Global Day of Code
 retreat  we are planning another retreat, this time with a slightly
  different take: The Legacy Coderetreat.  We invite a group of progr
 ammers together for a day, give them some legacy code, and help them p
 ractise various design rescue and improvement techniques. The ultimate
  goal is to practise these techniques in a low-stakes environment away
  from the code base that probably torments you at work.\n Which tech
 niques do you mean? \nWe don’t have a complete list, but most of o
 ur techniques revolve around creating and identifying seams in softwar
 e (places where we can decouple tightly-coupled modules). You will try
  adding tests, isolating behavior from frameworks, introducing mocks, 
 writing characterisation tests, and some other things we haven’t tho
 ught about yet. \nSo, it’s a  CodeRetreat \nSo far, mostly ye
 s. The difference is that we have starting code bases for you, rather 
 than asking you to start with a blank slate. Also, we are using the Co
 de Retreat format to teach specific techniques, so we guide your pract
 ice more like a (karate) dojo than Code Retreat does.\nThis edition wi
 ll be facilitated by Erik Talboom(@talboomerik) and Frederik Delbroek 
 (@frederikdelbr).\nFind Erik's blogpost on the Agileminds previous r
