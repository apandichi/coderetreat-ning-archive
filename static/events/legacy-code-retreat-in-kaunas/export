SUMMARY:Legacy code retreat in Kaunas
DESCRIPTION:A free-of-charge whole-day workshop for developers based o
 n the well-known Code Retreat format, only this time with an additiona
 l twist - we'll be working on someone's already written code.\nPartici
 pants will get their hands dirty in some old, messy, organically grown
 , hard to understand implementation of a game in the chosen programmin
 g language. The task is: using tests and best practices, raise the qua
 lity of code step by step without breaking existing behavior. The leg
 acy code has versions in Java, C#, Python, Ruby, C++, JavaScript and o
 ther languages - see https://github.com/jbrains/trivia\nParticipants w
 ill need to have laptop computers with prepared development environmen
 ts. Number of seats are limited. You should also indicate your program
 ming language of choice + what other languages you know (it may be nec
 essary as we'll work in pairs).\n \nTickets   https://www.eventbrite
