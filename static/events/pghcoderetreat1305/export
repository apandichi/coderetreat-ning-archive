SUMMARY:Pittsburgh Legacy Coderetreat
DESCRIPTION:Legacy Coderetreat returns to Pittsburgh!\nRegistration is
  now open.\n\nA Legacy Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice e
 vent focused on rescue techniques for liberating legacy code. Legacy C
 oderetreats use the base coderetreat format (which eliminates the pres
 sure of 'getting things done'), but focuses more on refactoring inheri
 ted code than creating new code.\nYou only need to bring a laptop with
  the development tools you require to write code using your chosen pro
 gramming languages.Â  Coffee and lunch will be provided.\nCheck out co
 deretreat.org and whatis.legacycoderetreat.com for further details on 
 what to expect.\nRefundable Deposit\nThe $15.00 registration deposit w
 ill be refunded in full when:\n\nyou attend the event\nyou notify the 
 organizers by Monday, April 29th that you are unable to attend\n\nAny 
 funds not refunded will be used to help fund future local Pittsburgh C
 oderetreats.\nThis event is hosted and sponsored by\n\n\nFor more info
