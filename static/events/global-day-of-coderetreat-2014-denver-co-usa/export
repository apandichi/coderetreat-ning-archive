SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Denver, CO, USA
DESCRIPTION:Pivotal Labs will be hosting a Denver instance of Code Ret
 reat as others around the world do the same. We'll meet at 8am at Pivo
 tal's office within Galvanize and spend the day practicing our craft o
 f programming.\nPair programming, test-driven development, and conscio
 us practice are the main themes of the day, which we will explore thro
 ugh the lens of a single programming problem in six 45 minute sessions
 . When a session is over, we'll talk about how we approached the probl
 em: how our choices of language, paradigm, and vocabulary shaped the s
 olution. We'll also think about how our approach to pairing affected t
 he kind of solution that was developed. At the end of the hour, we'll 
 delete our code, find a new pair, and explore the problem again.\nEver
 yone is welcome - beginner, intermediate, expert - and everyone will l
 earn something new, likely something unexpected, about the craft of pr
 ogramming. You'll need only a few things: a laptop with your favorite 
 development tools, an open mind, and a sense of humor for when we dele
 te our code.\nFood and drink (coffee, tea, soda-pop, but no alcohol)Â 
 will be provided for both breakfast and lunch. Once we're done, some m
 ight decide to socialize at a nearby pub.\nIf you will attend, please 
 register - there's a link to Eventbrite below - to help us ensure ther
 e is enough food for everyone to be happy.\nSee you in November!\n\nFo
