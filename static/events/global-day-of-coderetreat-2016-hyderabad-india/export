SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - Hyderabad, India
DESCRIPTION:CoderetreatÂ is a day-long, intensive practice event, focu
 sing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By provid
 ing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away 
 from the pressures of 'getting things done', the Coderetreat format ha
 s proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. P
 racticing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, 
 developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the 
 cost of change over time.\nFor an in-depth understanding of the philos
 ophy behind a day of Coderetreat, please watch this introduction video
