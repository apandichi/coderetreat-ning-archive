SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - Salt Lake City, Utah, United 
 States of America (USA)
DESCRIPTION:\nPlease RSVP via EventBrite\n\na day to celebrate passion
  and software craftsmanship\nEach year there’s a Saturday set aside 
 where developers around the world gather in person or online to medita
 te on their coding. It’s one of those global vibration gigs where yo
 u can feel the focus and concentration bouncing back and forth from In
 dia to Indiana. Our meditation is code, and we set aside this day to m
 erge intention with practice.\nCode Retreat is a “repeatable, day lo
 ng event focused on practicing the fundamentals of software developmen
 t.\" It’s an opportunity to learn (and re-learn) best practices, thi
 ngs like pairing with other developers and doing behavior driven devel
 opment. Participants get together in some convenient location and go t
 hrough a series of exercises that teach and reinforce various aspects 
 of working together on a problem and writing tests.\nFor each exercise
 , the problem is always the same: work on solving Conway’s Game of L
 ife. Sometimes, rarely, it actually gets solved, but that’s beside t
 he point. In fact, at the end of each exercise, participants are suppo
 sed to delete their code and start over.\nCode Retreats can happen any
  time, anywhere, but they’re best experienced on a Global Day of Cod
 e Retreat. This year, it’ll be October 22, 2016, and there will be m
 ore than 115 Code Retreats world wide. In Salt Lake City, we're hostin
 g one at O.C. Tanner Company.\nIn addition to hosting, O.C. Tanner wil
 l also sponsor food and beverages. We'll have morning snacks, a nice l
 unch (something that's not pizza), and afternoon snacks.  You're just
  responsible for bringing yourself and your computer.\nThis event will
  be facilitated by Sean Duncan, organizer of SLC JS Learners and SLC I
 ron Yard instructor, and Rob Martin, co-organizer of SLC Software Craf
 tsmanship, speaker, and trainer.\nPark at the south end of the main bu
 ilding, and enter through the main entrance.\n\nPlease RSVP via EventB
 rite\n\nFor more information visit http://coderetreat.org/events/globa
