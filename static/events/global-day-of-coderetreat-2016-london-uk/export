SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - London, UK
DESCRIPTION:Registration: http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craft
 smanship/events/234173628/ We are pleased to announce that Codurance t
 ogether with LSCC is participating to the Global Day of Coderetreat. 
 This year the event will happen on 22th of October. \nLast year's G
 lobal Day of Coderetreat attracted over 2000 developers from more tha
 n 150 cities around the world. It's becoming a regular fixture in the 
 global software development calendar, and by participating you will be
  a part of the history of software development: thousands of developer
 s coming together around the world to practise their craft.\nNOTE: Pl
 ease register for just one of them. LSCC is also organising other c
 oderetreats ( Masabi ). Take the empty spots on a different coderet
 reat instead of adding yourself to a waiting list.\nBreakfast and lun
 ch will be provided on the day. It's an early start, so sleep well the
  night before to help get those brain juices flowing.\nWatch our aweso
 me video (8 mins) from GDCR 2012 for a better idea: vimeo.com/560269

 a coderetreat?\nFrom the website: A Coderetreat is a day-long, inten
 sive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software developm
 ent and design.\nBy providing developers the opportunity to take par
 t in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done
 ', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective
  means of skill improvement. Practising the basic principles of modula
 r and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to 
 write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.\nHow does it
  work?\nThe coderetreat day consists of 5-6 sessions, each session's
  learnings building upon previous sessions. The morning focuses on bec
 oming comfortable with the problem domain, breaking old habits and beg
 inning focused self-discovery. The afternoon pushes the envelope by ch
 allenging pairs to stretch their skills and understanding of abstracti
 ons, modular design and test-driven development.\nCoderetreat has an e
 stablished, time-tested format that is optimized for focused practic
 e. We will be working on implementing Conway's Game of Life in 45-minu
 te sessions. In each one, you'll pair program in whichever language yo
 u like, using whichever technologies you and your pair prefer.\nThe da
 y will start with breakfast at 8:30am and finish by 5 or 6pm.\nMore in
