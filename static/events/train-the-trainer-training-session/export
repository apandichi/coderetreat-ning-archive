SUMMARY:Train the Trainer training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n\n \n\n\nThis training is for (facilita
 tor) trainers. Volunteers who will run the training sessions are invit
 ed to attend. This training will be delivered online on Google Plus Ha
 ngouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes before the training 
 starts.\n\nThe job of the facilitator is to help participants learn fr
 om each other. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose 
 and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere dur
 ing the day\nI will start with the different ways to run the trainings
  sessions I have witnessed so far. Then I will go through the relevant
  information new facilitators need to know in order to run a code retr
 eat. In the end there will be QA.\n\nFor more information visit http:/
