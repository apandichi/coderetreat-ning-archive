SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Lübeck, Germany
DESCRIPTION:We will celebrate the Global day of code retreat in Lüb
 eck!  During normal work we don´t have much time to work on our core 
 skills as developer. Under time pressure we often use known technics o
 r habits although we know that there are better ways.  As well as an a
 rtist we need to have a place where we can practice our skills and tha
 t´s what is a code retreat about.  In small sessions we work in pairs
  so solve a problem... the whole day. It´s not about being finished,
  it´s about learning, making errors, trying new ways and having a lot
  of fun.  Please bring a laptop with your favorite IDE with you so tha
 t we can start in time. Lunch and food is offered by Dräger. Afterwa
 rds we can have some beers in a pub.  The agenda:  8:00 : Arrival and
