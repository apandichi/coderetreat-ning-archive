SUMMARY:Host training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!This training is for hosts. If you host a

 . The trainers will explain what is the role of the host, tips and tri

 ypes of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat hosts and facilitators

 necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the pr
 izes at the end of the day, organize video chats with other locations,
  etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from e
 ach other. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose and
