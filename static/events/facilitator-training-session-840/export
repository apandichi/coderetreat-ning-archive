SUMMARY:Facilitator training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n\nThis training is for facilitators. An
 ybody interested in facilitating a coderetreat is invited to attend at
  least one training session. This training will be delivered online on
  Google Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes befor
 e the training starts.\nLike last year we will have two different type
 s of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facili
 tators.\nThe job of the host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoo
 thly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with al
 l the necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away 
 the prizes at the end of the day, organize video chats with other loca
 tions, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to help participants learn 
 from each other. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choos
 e and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere d
 uring the day\n\nImportant: All the times are in UTC. Do one of the fo
