SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:This training is for facilitators. Anybody interested in f
 acilitating a Coderetreat is invited to attend at least one training s
 ession. This training will be delivered online on Google Plus Events. 
 Make sure you will be online five minutes before the training starts. 
   Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for Gl
 obal Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.   The job of
  the host is to make sure the Coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure
  everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equ
 ipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the e
 nd of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.   The 
 job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. 
 Facilitators understand the Coderetreat format, choose and explain the
  constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.  F
