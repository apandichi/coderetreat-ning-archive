SUMMARY:Host training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n \n\nThis training is for hosts. If you
  host a coderetreat you might be interested in attending one training 
 session. The trainers will explain what is the role of the host, tips 
 and tricks for having an excellent coderetreat day. This training will
  be delivered online on Google Plus Events. Make sure you will be onli
 ne five minutes before the training starts.\nLike last year we will ha
 ve two different types of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for
  hosts and for facilitators.\nThe job of the host is to make sure the 
 coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts
  find a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to spon
 sor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video 
 chats with other locations, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to hel
 p participants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the code
 retreat format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep a 
 learning atmosphere during the day\n\nImportant: All the times are in
