SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Austin, TX, USA
DESCRIPTION:Once again we will participate in the Global Day of Code R
 etreat for 2015 in Austin, TX.\nRegister here: https://gdcr-austin-20
 15.eventbrite.com\nCoderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event
 , focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By 
 providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice,
  away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat for
 mat has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvem
 ent. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented de
 sign, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimize
 s the cost of change over time.\nMore specifically, individuals are ar
 e grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common proble
 m, ‘The Game of Life’. There are 6 sessions throughout the day and
  for each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted. Aft
 er each session there are session reflections to help with the interna
 lization of lessons.\nSnacks and lunches will be provided!\n\nFor more
