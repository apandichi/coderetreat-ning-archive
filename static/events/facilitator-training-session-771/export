SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session

 CEST (Central European Summer Time) UTC/GMT +2 hours\nGoole+ Event wit
 h Hangout\nThis training is for facilitators. Anybody interested in fa
 cilitating a coderetreat is invited to attend at least one training se
 ssion. This training will be delivered online on Google Plus Events. M
 ake sure you will be online five minutes before the training starts.  
 Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for Globa
 l Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.  The job of the 
 host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure ever
 ything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equipmen
 t, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of
  the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.  The job of 
 the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Facilit
 ators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain the constr
 aints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.\n\nFor mo
