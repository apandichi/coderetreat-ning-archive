SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:It's a Google Hangout event. Please RSVP here:\nhttps://pl
 us.google.com/events/cu98vpqd3omhjr0u81l8f04dip0\nThis training is for
  facilitators. Anybody interested in facilitating a Coderetreat is inv
 ited to attend at least one training session. This training will be de
 livered online on Google Plus Events. Make sure you will be online fiv
 e minutes before the training starts. Like last year we will have two
  different types of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for hosts
  and for facilitators. The job of the host is to make sure the Codere
 treat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts find 
 a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor lu
 nch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video chats 
 with other locations, etc. The job of the facilitator is to help part
 icipants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the Coderetrea
 t format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learni
 ng atmosphere during the day.\nImportant: All the times are in UTC. D
 o one of the following to view training times in your time zone:\n\nAd
