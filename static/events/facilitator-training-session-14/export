 east one training session. This training will be delivered online on G
 oogle Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes before

 of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilita
 tors.\nThe job of the host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smooth
 ly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all 
 the necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away th
 e prizes at the end of the day, organize video chats with other locati
 ons, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to help participants learn fr
 om each other. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose 
 and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere dur
 ing the day\nImportant: All the times are in UTC. Do one of the follow
