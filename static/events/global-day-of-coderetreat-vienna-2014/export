SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 - Vienna, Austria
DESCRIPTION:Since we started with the first Global Day of Coderetreat 
 in 2011 Vienna already has a vivid crowd of software craftsmen, which 
 is key for great companies and products, fit for the future. Software 
 craftsmanship is the missing link many of us often even miss in so cal
 led Agile projects.  This year we have Peter Kofler as facilitator on 
 board. Peter probably is the most experienced facilitator for Coding D
 ojos and Coderetreats around Vienna at the moment. He just did his jou
 rneyman tour and many different facilitations as well as public talks.
  So your chances to learn great stuff at our event are tremendous. And
  of course it will be great fun too!  Want to join as participant? Ge
 t your ticket here (it's free, we just ask for a deposit, which will b
 e returned immediately to those showing up) -http://gdcr13-vienna.even
 tbrite.de Know others, your friends, peers at work, who might be inter
 ested too? Please, help spreading the word and tell them about our eve
 nt.  Want to see your company as sponsor? Please get in contact with 
 us a toffice@agileexperts.at  Looking forward to seeing you at the GDC
 R13 Vienna! best, Mike Leber  PS: we are currently in touch with 2-3 
 options for the location in Vienna and let you know soon about it.\n\n
