SUMMARY:Host training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n\nThis training is for hosts. If you ho
 st a Coderetreat you might be interested in attending one training ses
 sion. The trainers will explain what is the role of the host, tips and
  tricks for having an excellent coderetreat day. This training will be
  delivered online on Google Plus Events. Make sure you will be online 
 five minutes before the training starts.\n\nLike last year we will hav
 e two different types of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for 
 hosts and for facilitators.\n\nThe job of the host is to make sure the
  coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Host
 s find a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to spo
 nsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video
  chats with other locations, etc.\n\nThe job of the facilitator is to 
 help participants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the c
 oderetreat format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep
  a learning atmosphere during the day\n\n\n\nImportant: All the times
