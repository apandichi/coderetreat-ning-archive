SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Arnhem, Netherlands
DESCRIPTION:Global Day of Code Retreat 2015, November 14 at Luminis Ar
 nhem\nNovember 14, 2015, is this year's Global Day of Code Retreat. T
 his is a day for us, as developers, to hone our skills, share knowledg
 e, and honor the craft of software engineering.\nLuminis Arnhem will f
 acilitate a coderetreat at our offices in Arnhem. We will provide you 
 with both the facilities and the necessary guidance to get the most ou
 t of this day. While we will provide you with exercises and training f
 orms, we remain technology agnostics: you can do your training in any 
 language and tool chain you--and your pair--like.\nWhat is a coderetre
 at?\nCoderetreat is a day-­long, intensive practice event focusing on
  the fundamentals of software development and design. The coderetreat
  format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill impr
 ovement by providing developers the opportunity to take part in focus
 ed practice away from the pressures of 'getting things done.'\nProgram
