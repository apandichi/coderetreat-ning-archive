&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to let you know that we ran the first legacy coderetreat of 2012 in Belgium a little over a week ago. I wrote down a short story about it, that you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://talboomerik.be/2012/03/22/practicing-legacy-rescue-techniques/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So we only got to do 5 sessions. People really responded well to most of the constraints although it forced them to go outside of their comfort zone. Especially the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TDD as if you meant it&lt;/a&gt; was hard, that&#039;s why we decided to do 2 of those, just to get the feeling of it.&lt;/p&gt;
