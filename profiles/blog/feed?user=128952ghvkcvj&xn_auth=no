&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;A Day Like No Other, Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Last year, on December 3rd, 2011, over 1800 developers in 94 cities through 14 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft. This was Global Day of Coderetreat 2011.

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Last year, on December 3rd, 2011, over 1800 developers in 94 cities through 14 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft. This was Global Day of Coderetreat 2011. Video calls criss-crossed the globe, as groups linked to say hello to other cities, welcoming each other to an amazing day spent working on improving their fundamental development skills. I had the honor of facilitating 2 events on that day, kicking the day off in Sydney, Australia, then jumping across the International Date Line, going back in time, to close the day by facilitating the last event in Honolulu, Hawaii. Since Global Day of Coderetreat 2011, we have seen the number of events grow to the point where it is rare to find a weekend without at least 2 workshops happening somewhere in the world. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=13.007757,146.540268&amp;amp;spn=150.880909,12.304688&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;map of cities from last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on that day, we announced a new community network at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coderetreat.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coderetreat.org&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of a non-profit foundation to support practice-oriented events and help fund activities to encourage kids to learn to program called the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the enormous success of last year, we are doing it again in 2012! On December 8, 2012, developers world-wide will once again sit down and share a day like no other, creating a network across the globe of people caring about getting better at a core aspect of what we do: writing maintainable software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, at its heart, coderetreat is a local event, organized and facilitated by volunteers, and we had a wonderful group of people step up to host last year. This year is no different, and we are looking forward to working with old and new hosts and facilitators around the world. We are putting together a great global organizing group to help coordinate the world, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jthurne&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jim Hurne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adibolb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adrian Bolboaca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/talboomerik&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Talboom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/volunteerjunkie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alissa Conaty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, last year was awesome, and this year is going to be even more amazing. GDCR11 started with a blog post putting out the idea of getting maybe 20 cities together on a single day to do a coderetreat, and ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=13.007757,146.540268&amp;amp;spn=150.880909,12.304688&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;94 cities in 14 time zones&lt;/a&gt;. This year, for GDCR12, let&#039;s step it up a notch. My goal for this year is 200 cities. Yup, 200! With an average of 15-20 developers at each event, this will mean we have 3000-4000 developers around the world sharing in this amazing day. Can we do it? Of course we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks, we&#039;ll be putting out a lot more information about taking part in Global Day of Coderetreat 2012 (GDCR12). So stay tuned by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coderetreat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@coderetreat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23gdcr12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#gdcr12 hashtag&lt;/a&gt;. We&#039;re already seeing events starting to be registered on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org/events/event/listByDate?date=2012-12-8&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;GDCR12 event page&lt;/a&gt;.  As they get added to the event page, I&#039;m putting them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&amp;amp;msa=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the map of registered GDCR 2012 cities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, yes, I plan on doing the Sydney-Honolulu crazy time-traveling activity again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;That&#039;s cool, but you know what is really cool?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200 cities is a cool goal, but you know what would be really cool? A short video call with someone on the International Space Station. Do you think you can help us do this? If so, please contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:coreyhaines+gdcr12@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coreyhaines@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;Want to host an event in your city for Global Day of Coderetreat 2012?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting a participating event is pretty straightforward. You&#039;ll need to secure a location, get enough local sponsorship for lunch (and possibly morning coffee, if possible, since we do start early), and find a facilitator for the day. We&#039;re working on a sponsorship prospectus that you can use to help explain the day to possible sponsors in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR12, please fill in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGpyc2wzT1pNeFhKcmlaOE94bGJlc3c6MQ#gid=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;. I will add you to the organizers mailing list where you can share and get help from other hosts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;Want to become a local or global sponsor of Global Day of Coderetreat 2012?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:coreyhaines+gdcr12@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coreyhaines@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#039;ll give you more information about the options. We&#039;ll be preparing more information about sponsorship levels, but a global sponsorship secures your place in front of a project 3000-4000 developers world-wide. Show your support for developers around the world with a global sponsorship. We&#039;ll have some administrative costs (stickers, travel, organizational costs), but extra sponsorship goes into the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, a non-profit focused on supporting the goal of teaching kids to program.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is an exciting program for girls (grades 5-8) to compete in a national competition to create a STEM-focused video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjD2xZn8XGjJsdmNYG34JRqCoKywXTmG1e*mJyjJpYLVgGiD4NUC2wNUzRP13mlooK3odkcpnJFoqjtpoiHvaC0cqtXybcYo/Black_Girls_Code_2012.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/fjD2xZn8XGjJsdmNYG34JRqCoKywXTmG1e*mJyjJpYLVgGiD4NUC2wNUzRP13mlooK3odkcpnJFoqjtpoiHvaC0cqtXybcYo/Black_Girls_Code_2012.jpeg?width=750&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 15, I facilitated a coderetreat in Cleveland, OH, sponsored by the excellent folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leandog.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leandog Software&lt;/a&gt;. While all public community coderetreats are free, we had a $20 refundable attendance deposit with an explanation that any money left over would go directly to the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f). As a result of no-shows and explicit donations by attendees, we were able to raise $400! I immediately looked for a kids programming event to sponsor. Kimberly Bryant from Black Girls Code has been doing a lot of great work with under-served girls, and I thought it would be a fantastic first sponsorship. I contacted Kimberly and have sent our first sponsorship check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple months, I&#039;ll be facilitating some coderetreats with an explicit goal of fund-raising for more kids programming events, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kidscodecamp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;KidsCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; and a Black Girls Code event in Chicago in May. I&#039;ll also be publishing more information on how people and organizations can contribute to this cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really excited to watch the progress these girls will make during the 6 weeks of the National STEM Video Game Challenge. It is an awesome event, and Kimberly&#039;s work is an inspiration. You can follow their progress on twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blackgirlscode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BlackGirlsCode&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to partnering in the future, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackgirlscode.com/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;About Black Girls Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BlackGirlsCode was founded by Kimberly Bryant a Biotechnology/Engineering professional who received her first taste of computer programming as a freshman in Electrical Engineering back when Fortran and Pascal were still the popular languages for newbies in the computing world and the &#039;Apple Macintosh&#039; was the new kid on the block. Kimberly decided to launch BlackGirlsCode to meet the needs of young women of color who are underrepresented in the currently exploding field of technology. Much has changed since those days and the mission of BlackGirlsCode is to introduce programming and technology to a new generation of coders who will become the leaders and creators of tomorrow. Our goal: Build the Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org/about/c3f&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;About the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund (c3f) operates as a non-profit and is under review for 501(c)(3) status. The fund has two primary missions: help support local, community-oriented practice events; and, be a central umbrella organization for supporting the wide variety of programs focused on teaching kids to program. The c3f was founded to be a central, trusted place where individuals and organizations could donate money, knowing that it will be going to a worthy cause. We will be opening up more information about how contribution works soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat events are easy to organize, only requiring enough sponsorship for venue and lunch. It is easy to find a sponsor in cities with strong company presence, but there are a lot of places that don&#039;t necessarily have this. Unfortunately, this can be a detriment to running coderetreats and other community-focused, practice-oriented events. To this end, we are establishing the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, the c3f, currently operating as a non-profit and under review for 501(c)(3) status. The c3f is currently being formed to subsidize and support local coderetreat events in areas without a strong company sponsorship presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before too long, basic programming skills and understanding are going to be as important as basic literacy; in fact, they are going to be an essential part of it. Unfortunately, the state of kids programming instruction is fragmented. There are a lot of fantastic programs running, such as KidsRuby, Hackety-Hack, Jason Gorman&#039;s Developer-Teacher matchups and Stephen Howell&#039;s work with Scratch, but these programs are all running in isolation. There are also a lot of initiatives in Academia, most of which have no idea about the industry programs. By bringing them together and focusing on our common goals, though, we can support each other and make a much larger impact. To this end, the long-term mission of the coderetreat community contribution fund is to help bridge the communication and support for these otherwise isolated programs. By creating a centralized organization, we also provide a beacon for large-scale support. The goal is to generate larger donations from both industry and academia that can then be used to effectively push the kids programming activities forward in a concerted way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just in the early planning stages of the organization, and more information will be coming over the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Starting over allows experimentation without the baggage of previous experiments. To ensure the objectives of the coderetreat are met and that the participants get the maximum value out of the event, it is essential to have a facilitator for the day of coderetreat. The facilitator&#039;s role is to guide the participants through the various paths of experimentation, putting appropriate pressure at each stage of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary activity of a coderetreat facilitator is to act as a guide both during and between the coding sessions. She should be walking around, observing the approaches pairs are taking, suggesting alternate approaches, constraints, etc. The facilitator should also choose what activities and exercises are appropriate for each session based on the activity of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more experience a facilitator has, the more alternate methods, the more alternate approaches to the problem she has seen. It is important that the facilitator not code during the sessions and devote their time to facilitation. And facilitating does not include coding with the participants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be visiting each pair and commenting, asking questions, helping them progress.  Having seen these approaches and where they lead, she can help guide others through the self-discovery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first important role of the facilitator is to introduce the day. At a minimum, the introduction should contain five elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a brief history/philosophy of coderetreat;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the format of the day;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goals for the day;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an explanation of Conway&#039;s Game of Life;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, the 4 rules of simple design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t need to provide a great amount of detail around the rules of the game of life, as the first session provides the opportunity for people to dive more deeply into the problem domain. While each of my introductions is slightly different, some focusing more on specifics, some more on the overall goals of the day, the overall message stays consistent. You can get a sense of an introduction from this video that was recorded at the Cleveland coderetreat in January, 2011.

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been emphasizing the message that the goal of modular/object-oriented/simple design boils down to minimizing the cost of change. For a business, it is essential to be able to change easily. Our systems should be designed to accept this and move as rapidly and cheaply as possible with the business. I like to contrast this with YAGNI, which is building features you don&#039;t need yet. If your system is easy to change, then you don&#039;t need to build those features yet. You can just add them easily when the time comes. I address how the 4 rules of simple design contribute to minimizing the cost of change: tests tell you if you broke something; no duplication allows you to make a change in one place for all pieces of knowledge in your system; good names allow you to easily understand the structure of your design and where you should make your change; small helps keep your head above water when looking through the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sessions progress, the facilitator&#039;s role is to select appropriate topics to focus on during each one. For example, the first session is generally used to gain familiarity with the problem domain. Understanding when to introduce different activities comes through experience, as you really start to gain a view into how people&#039;s approaches change over the course of the day. There is no &#039;one true progression&#039; of exercises through the day, though; some facilitators like to introduce tdd as if you meant it before lunch. I like to introduce it, if at all, during the session immediately following lunch. Also, which exercises are introduced is a function of the makeup of the participants. If you have people who have never tested before, then you might not introduce tdd as if you meant it, prefering to bring in a different testing-oriented practice. If you have people who are very experienced with testing, you might introduce it sooner and really push hard on them to write the simplest code possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the inter-session reflection, it is important to take the observations of the previous session and reflect them back to the participants. For example, there are a couple different starting points that almost everyone takes during the first session: cell or grid. Ask how many people did the cell, how many people did the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the cell people, ask how many people had some form of flag called &#039;alive&#039;?  During the session, you&#039;ll have noticed a lot of people with this. I then talk a bit about using polymorphism to replace flags. Ask why you need the flag. Ask how you know you need it. Why do you need a cell class? Either after the first or second session, I like to introduce the idea of verb-focused design, rather than noun-focused. Whenever you are tempted to create a noun (class, property, etc), ask yourself why you need it. If your answer involves another noun, ask why you need that one. Eventually, you&#039;ll make it to the verb, the process that you are trying to automate. Start with the process, the verb, rather than the noun. I like to push this practice throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grid people, ask how many people spent time looking in the documentation for how to make a 2-dimensional array. Ask people to think what that means considering the &#039;infinite grid&#039; requirement. Ask how their implementation would change if the topology changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another set of constraints is around clean code. I put a list of code-level constraints and ask them to keep these in mind and practice during the sessions. Here are some of my favorites: methods &amp;lt; 5 lines (perhaps &amp;lt; 3); minimize number of methods per class (&amp;lt; 3?); no naked language primitives; no built-in data structures. The objective here is to make the participants think about approaches they wouldn&#039;t have normally done on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of the day, the facilitator should guide the closing circle. This is an essential part of the day, as it bring everyone together to share what they&#039;ve learned from the day. It is not a report back to the facilitator, but a sharing with the rest of the group. The group should stand in a circle and answer 3 questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what, if anything, did you learn today;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what, if anything, surprised you about today;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, what, if anything, are you going to do differently moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing these answers, the group comes together and closes what was an intense day of working together to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I have never facilitated before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time like the present. After all, there was a time when nobody had facilitated a coderetreat before. The most important part of facilitation is being observant. Your job is not to teach, but to guide. As you walk around during the sessions, you&#039;ll notice similarities between approaches. Highlight those during the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best first step in learning to facilitate is to attend a coderetreat as a participant. Watch the facilitator and take notes. Spend the day focused not just on coding, but also on understanding what the goals of the day are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a few very experienced facilitators out there. Contact one and ask if they have some time to answer questions: find out any concrete things they tend to focus on; do they have a preferred order for introducing constraints; any common things they say that people respond well to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I mess up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take a lot to mess it up. The more experienced you are, the more insights you can share with the participants. But, think about this: you are getting a bunch of programmers together, pairing and practicing, with a person whose sole purpose is to highlight new thoughts and exercises to try. Sounds like a pretty awesome day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
