&lt;p&gt;(Original post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://athos.blogs.balabit.com/2012/12/global-day-of-code-retreat-2012/&quot;&gt;http://athos.blogs.balabit.com/2012/12/global-day-of-code-retreat-2012/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday was about the second &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalday.coderetreat.org/&quot;&gt;Global Day of Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt; for us with &lt;a href=&quot;http://c0de-x.com/&quot;&gt;DeVill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/coderetreatbudapest/photos_stream&quot;&gt;15 other developers&lt;/a&gt; in Budapest, when more than 3000 developers in 160 cities came together to practice the basic moves of programming, or software craftsmanship if you like, just like painters, musicians, dancers and martial artists do, by pair programming with developers they never met before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, when I participated in the first event organized in Budapest by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meza.hu/&quot;&gt;Meza&lt;/a&gt;, I wouldn&#039;t have thought that I would be a facilitator of the next one. It was awesome to be part of the event! When I went to sleep on Friday, the first coderetreats of the day were already started, so it was very hard to get into the bed while the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gdcr12&quot;&gt;#gdcr12&lt;/a&gt; tweets were appearing on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event was a special one. Not just because this was the first code retreat in Budapest where girls attended as well, but because during the day we waved to fellow developers at Zurich, Nuremberg and London through Google Hangouts, all of these locations having at least one organizer or facilitator from Hungary! (We also tried to say Hello, but some sound issues kicked in. :-( )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, just like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://athos.blogs.balabit.com/tag/coderetreat/&quot;&gt;earlier code retreats&lt;/a&gt;, I learnt a lot. For example, that you should be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; careful with your hotkeys and typing when programming in a language that supports unicode characters in identifiers, like Java or PHP. An invisible character somewhere, and your code is screwed for seemingly no reason! (Imagine what level of code obfuscation could be reached by using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1137/&quot;&gt;RTL&lt;/a&gt; marks!) Someone mentioned during the closing circle that he starts every morning with a 20-25 minutes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)&quot;&gt;coding kata&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great idea I&#039;m going to adopt as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you everybody for this day, I can&#039;t wait for the next one!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
