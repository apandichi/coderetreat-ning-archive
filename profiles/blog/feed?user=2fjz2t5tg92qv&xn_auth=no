                        &lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been waiting for it for a long time. Lots of people join together all around the world to improve their skills as Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the chance of attending the Madrid meeting. It was carried on by Enrique Comba. There I found a lot of people that I met first time in another Code Retreat, a year ago. I met new people too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been waiting for it for a long time. Lots of people join together all around the world to improve their skills as Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the chance of attending the Madrid meeting. It was carried on by Enrique Comba. There I found a lot of people that I met first time in another Code Retreat, a year ago. I met new people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that I must not to be there. I already have been practising the &#039;kata&#039; and I already knew the result. But some time later, realize that the solution doesn&#039;t matter. It is the people who matters. It is more important to speak with them, to think with them. It doesn&#039;t matters if you get the answer. The real important thing is that you met another people, and each of them allows you to see the same problem from another perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt a lot. I realize I was trying to solve the problem by my own, without my mate. In another team, we didn&#039;t write a lot of code, but we could think about the mistery of life. In another one, the same happened, but about the abstraction of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very short day, and it was a very important opportunity to meet some people who does mind about our job, about computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I feel lucky for having been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all, organization teams, mates, friends. Thank you for your comments or your thoughts, for your your words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
