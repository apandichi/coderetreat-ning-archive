&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are very excited to announce this year&#039;s Global Day of Coderetreat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, November 15th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;, thousands of developers all over the globe will join us to honor our craft, share knowledge, and practice by “playing our instruments behind the scenes” to learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, over 170 Coderetreats and more than 5,000 registered participants all over the globe joined us for the Global Day of Coderetreat. This year we expect even more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is a coderetreat?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat is a day-­long, intensive practice event focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. The coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement by providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice away from the pressures of &#039;getting things done.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel the need to bring the idea of scale- and etude-type practices into development, then join us and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can you celebrate the GDCR?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Participating&lt;/strong&gt; in a local coderetreat and freeing yourself to experiment and try new techniques, learning from each other, writing the best code you can by focusing on some basic principles of well-written code and challenging many of our everyday assumption. Interested? Information about local events will be published on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gdcr.coderetreat.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GDCR Website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org/events/event/listByType?type=gdcr14&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;coderetreat.org events section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Hosting&lt;/strong&gt; a coderetreat of your own in your city. Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding a local sponsor, running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration. Don&#039;t worry if you haven&#039;t hosted a coderetreat yet. We are here to support you and we will provide you many resources to help you organize an amazing event. If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat in your city for GDCR 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gdcr14_leader_reg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;please submit this form&lt;/a&gt; and we will add you to the facilitator/host mailing lists where you can get help from other facilitators/hosts from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Facilitating&lt;/strong&gt; a coderetreat of your own in your city. Facilitators guide participants through the exercises and lead the retrospectives. Don&#039;t worry if you haven&#039;t facilitated a coderetreat yet. We are here to support you! We will provide you with resources and online training sessions. If you are interested in facilitating/hosting a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gdcr14_leader_reg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;please submit this form&lt;/a&gt; and we will add you to the facilitator/host mailing lists where you can get help from other facilitators and hosts from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us to make the next generation of software developers better! The Global Day of Coderetreat helps to support the efforts to find, encourage, and educate the next generation of software developers through the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund.This year year we will support &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderdojo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CoderDojo&lt;/a&gt; (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;GDCR 2014 Edition will be brought to you by hundreds of passionate local facilitators worldwide and a team of global coordinators, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jthurne&quot;&gt;Jim Hurne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adibolb&quot;&gt;Adrian Bolboaca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martinklose&quot;&gt;Martin Klose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ElenaYankova1&quot;&gt;Elena Yankova&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m happy to announce this year&#039;s Global Day of Coderetreat will be held on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, December 14th, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, on December 8th, 2012, over 2000 developers in 150 cities through 20 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft during the Global Day of Coderetreat 2012.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;A Day Like No Other, Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m happy to announce this year&#039;s Global Day of Coderetreat will be held on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, December 14th, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, on December 8th, 2012, over 2000 developers in 150 cities through 20 time zones dedicated the day to practicing their craft during the Global Day of Coderetreat 2012. Video calls traversed the globe as groups linked to say hello to other cities and welcomed each other to an amazing day spent working on improving our fundamental development skills. Since Global Day of Coderetreat 2011, we have seen the number of events grow to the point where it is rare to find a weekend without at least 2 workshops happening somewhere in the world. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;ll=38.272689,-7.734375&amp;amp;spn=164.696857,90&amp;amp;z=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;map of cities from last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the enormous success of the last two years, we are doing it again in 2013! On December 14th, 2013, developers world-wide will once again sit down and share a day like no other; creating a network across the globe of people caring about getting better at what we do: writing maintainable software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, at its heart coderetreat is a local event organized and facilitated by volunteers. We have had a wonderful group of people step up to host the last two years. This year is no different! We are looking forward to working with old and new hosts and facilitators around the world. We are putting together a great team of global coordinators, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jthurne&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jim Hurne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adibolb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adrian Bolboaca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/volunteerjunkie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alissa Conaty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two years were &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; and this year is going to be even more amazing. The first GDCR in 2011 started with a blog post putting out the idea of getting maybe 20 cities together on a single day to do a coderetreat and ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004b0b076e7ed3148f35&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=13.007757,146.540268&amp;amp;spn=150.880909,12.304688&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;94 cities in 14 time zones&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, GDCR12 included &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211858429594081017615.0004c84674c62aa900e06&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;ll=38.272689,-7.734375&amp;amp;spn=164.696857,90&amp;amp;z=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;150 cities in 20 time zones&lt;/a&gt;.  This year, let&#039;s push the limits even further. &lt;strong&gt;Our goal for this year is 200 cities&lt;/strong&gt;. With an average of 15-20 developers at each event, this will mean we have 3000-4000 developers around the world sharing in this amazing day. Can we do it? Of course we can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks, we will send out out a lot more information about taking part in Global Day of Coderetreat 2013 (GDCR13). So stay tuned by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coderetreat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@coderetreat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#%21/search/?q=%23gdcr13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#gdcr13 hashtag&lt;/a&gt;. We&#039;re already seeing events starting to be registered on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gdcr13events&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GDCR13 event page&lt;/a&gt;.  As they get added to the event page, we&#039;re putting them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gdcr13map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the map of registered GDCR 2013 cities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;Want to host an event in your city for Global Day of Coderetreat 2013?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting a participating event is pretty straightforward. You&#039;ll need to secure a location, get enough local sponsorship for lunch (and possibly morning coffee, if possible, since we do start early), and find a facilitator for the day. We&#039;re working on a sponsorship prospectus that you can use to help explain the day to possible sponsors in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR13, please submit &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gdcr13forhosts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;please submit this form&lt;/a&gt;. We will add you to the organizers mailing lists where you can share and get help from other hosts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;Want to become a local or global sponsor of Global Day of Coderetreat 2013?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gdcr@coderetreat.org&lt;/a&gt;, and we will give you more information about the options. We&#039;ll be preparing more information about sponsorship levels, but a global sponsorship secures your place in front of a projected 3000-4000 developers world-wide. Show your support for developers around the world with a global sponsorship. We&#039;ll have some administrative costs (stickers, organizational costs, etc), but the extra sponsorship goes into the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, a non-profit focused on supporting the goal of teaching kids to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-3&quot;&gt;Want to help with the global coordination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of work to organize and coordinate a global event like the Global Day of Coderetreat. We&#039;re always looking for new volunteers to help us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design and manage the websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assist with training new hosts and facilitators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create promotional materials and templates for use by local event hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answer questions on the event mailing lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help with general event record-keeping and tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to take-it-up-a-notch and help out with any of the above, then email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gdcr@coderetreat.org&lt;/a&gt;! We would love to have you join the global coordinator team.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you do. On Saturday morning, at ridiculous o’clock (i.e. around 8), you walk into a room which has a delicious breakfast all laid out. There are some people running about shouting at each other about “sessions” and “calls”, but you ignore them in favour of the sweet pastries, fresh fruit and hot coffee sitting on the counter.

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you do. On Saturday morning, at ridiculous o’clock (i.e. around 8), you walk into a room which has a delicious breakfast all laid out. There are some people running about shouting at each other about “sessions” and “calls”, but you ignore them in favour of the sweet pastries, fresh fruit and hot coffee sitting on the counter. When you’re done, you take out your laptop, and someone with a funny haircut floats over to remind you that you should have a test environment set up for your language(s) of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mingle for about half an hour. What are you working on, what languages do you use, how enterprisey is it… that king of thing. Eventually, that same guy with the funny haircut stands up and talks. He tells you you’re going to be working on implementing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&quot;&gt;Conway’s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;, you’re going to be pairing, and you’re going to be writing tests. He also tells you that two thousand other people across the globe are, on this day, 3rd December 2011, doing exactly the same thing. Cool, right? You want to get cracking, but suddenly, there’s a bunch of Belgians on the projector, waving. A man with long hair says hi, and someone over on your end asks him how the first iteration went. Of course, it’s an hour later over there. They seem to have enjoyed it—lots of grinning. It’s a bit awkward, what with no one knowing each other, but quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you find another coder who likes C# and get to work. His name’s, oh, I don’t know, Fred. Fred’s a good name. The room’s buzzing as people natter about the closed tube station, the food, the weather and, most importantly, which test they should be writing first. You go for “the grid is 100x100”. Cells go on a grid, right? Let’s start with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code code code code code. You’ve been coding for twenty minutes. Not that long in the grand scheme of things, but the man with the funny haircut did mention you only have forty-five. Just then, that same man swings over to stare at your code. He asks why you have a grid. You tell him cells go on a grid. He asks you where in the rules it says that, so you flip over to Wikipedia to have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right. Kind of. Of course there’s a grid. But then he tells you not to worry and shoots off to hassle the next pair, leaving you feeling slightly bemused. You ignore him, and get on with the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hear a ringing sound, and look up to see the funny-haired man tapping the side of his coffee mug very loudly with a spoon. Is it time already? Forty-five minutes goes quick—much quicker than you’d realised. He’s bellowing, “DELETE YOUR CODE!” You thought that was a joke. You don’t want to destroy your hard work, but your pair, who’s done this before, assures you it’s a good idea. Well, it’s not like you got very far anyway. Other people are gathering in the room you’re sitting, looking at the funny-haired man expectantly as he begins to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, how did it go?” he asks in his odd accent. You hadn’t noticed how odd it was before, but he definitely originates from somewhere else. That also explains the hair. Weirdo. Anyway, back to the question. It went alright, you guess. Got somewhere. Not too much done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who managed to implement the first rule?” Well, you didn’t do that. You barely had enough time to get the grid up and running, let alone the rules. A quick poll shows that about half the room didn’t have a grid, just a cell. He reminds you that the point of the exercise is to implement the rules, not a grid. Perhaps you’ll focus more on them next time. Just get the bare minimum up before attacking them. Better find a new pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This time, you’ll focus on &lt;a href=&quot;http://agile.dzone.com/articles/4-rules-simple-design&quot;&gt;the four rules of simple design&lt;/a&gt;.” He’s written them up on the whiteboard, and they’re also sitting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CoderetreatLdn&quot;&gt;the Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. Alright, easy enough. No duplication? That’s second nature to you. You find another pair and get to work. This time, you’re working in Ruby. You don’t know Ruby, but it’ll be fun to learn it. This, of course, means you’re sitting back and watching a little, and so your pair, Tom, drives the first test: “a cell should have neighbours”. It looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;describe &#039;cell&#039; do&lt;br/&gt;it &#039;has neighbours&#039; do&lt;br/&gt;
    cell = Cell.new&lt;br/&gt;
    cell.add_neighbour&lt;br/&gt;
    cell.add_neighbour&lt;br/&gt;
    cell.neighbours.length.should == 2&lt;br/&gt;
  end&lt;br/&gt;
end&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start implementing it. It goes quickly. You’re just about to start on the second test, which you get to drive, when you’re interrupted by the man who was asking the Belgians questions earlier. Someone asks him where his moustache is. He laughs and tells them Movember’s over, and then stares at your code a little. He points at your first test and asks you, “does that express every idea we need to express?” Of course it does, you previously-moustached man. A cell needs neighbours. You don’t answer, but Tom says something to the same effect. The response: “But what are those neighbours?” Cells, obviously. “Where does it say that in your test?” Before you can think of a snarky reply about his mother, he’s moved onto the next question: “Why can you access &lt;code&gt;neighbours&lt;/code&gt;? Do you have the minimal amount of methods and fields?” Well, no. But you need to test it somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ask why, not what. Why do we need to know the number of neighbours?” So we know whether the cell is dead or not. Right. You swear an oath on your honour to kill him later, sort out your test so it asks the right questions, and fix your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retrospective for this one goes well. People explain how they got to a better design by thinking about expression and intent. People talk about the four game rules as acceptance tests, used to drive behaviour. It dives into a deep discussion about testing and outside-in vs. inside-out before it’s cut off. Apparently there’s a call at 12:30 with Stockholm and they’d like to keep the schedule. Before you can blink, you’re onto the next session: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/11/06/object-calisthenics-first-thoughts/&quot;&gt;object calisthenics&lt;/a&gt;. Write the best object-oriented code you can. You already know how to write object-oriented code—you’re an excellent C# developer—so this one should be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with the test, of course. You’re not an animal. You and your new pair, Bob, decide to take the advice from the previous test to heart and type this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;@Test public void aLiveCellWithFewerThanTwoLiveNeighboursDies() {&lt;br/&gt;Cell cell = new Cell(1);&lt;br/&gt;
    assertFalse(cell.isAlive());&lt;br/&gt;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. &lt;code&gt;isAlive&lt;/code&gt; is a getter. It’s right there. The last rule. No getters or setters. You talk about it, and neither of you can figure out how to work around this rule. AAARRGGHHHHHHH. Why is writing such a simple test so difficult? You keep talking until that smiling git without a moustache shows up and asks you why you’ve got a getter. “Because how else do we test it?” “Tell, don’t ask. What does your object &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;?” It lives or dies, duh. “No, that’s what it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Its state. What’s its behaviour?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t know. “You should probably figure that out.” Eventually, it hits you. You need to show it somehow. So you rewrite your test to have it “display” the cell to an interface and stub it to assign to a variable. Excellent. Now you can make progress. Or so you think, until the funny-haired man starts banging his spoon against his coffee mug. He’s not shouting “DELETE YOUR CODE”, but everyone else is, chanting in unison as they engage in the destruction of their hard-earned work as if it were a ritual slaughter. It almost is. The discussion for this one is fascinating. Many found the last rule the hardest in this situation, but people were asking about all of them, wondering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’d want to keep your classes to a maximum of two fields. It seems ridiculous. And wrapping &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; primitives? Wow. You collectively come to the realisation that these are guidelines, not hard and fast rules: you shouldn’t be afraid to break them, but you should understand why you’re doing so. The funny-haired man talks about how they make you name things, which in turn makes you think about what something actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. One guy points out how this goes against a lot of ideas about how functional code is supposed to look. He’s right, it does. Functional programming and object-oriented programming do often go in two different directions. You knew that, but you’d not really seen any evidence before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch. Lunch is delicious. Simple fare, mostly sandwiches, but tasty. You were hoping that by “no pizza” they meant “roast duck and potatoes”, but this will fill the belly. The conversation starts on the morning’s work but quickly flies off in all directions. You end up talking about hack days with the only female developer who showed up. Apparently there really is one for everything. You’re midway through explaining why you’ll never develop for iPhone on principle when someone yells at all of you to get back into the meeting room for an impromptu call with Spain. Of all things. It’s slightly mental—the Spaniards’ faces are on a laptop being held up by Sans Moustache rather than the projector, but it’s pretty funny and everyone on both ends seems to be enjoying themselves. You’re just getting a rapport going when the laptop battery dies and the video cuts out, which just adds to the laughter. You dive out of the room ahead of everybody else to grab the last fish skewer, which you spied just before you were dragged inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session four. You’re told you talked too much over lunch, so this time, you’re not going to talk to your pair. Exceptions are made for explaining how the languages and IDEs work, but that’s it: you must communicate only through your code. The importance of expressive tests are highlighted. You find a pair. You forget to ask his name, but it doesn’t matter. He writes the first test. Not what you would have written, but you make it pass anyway. By returning a constant. You write the next test, and make him actually implement the functionality he clearly intended for you to write. He gives you a Look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Look gets traded back and forth over the next three-quarters of an hour. Cooperation devolves into competition and you drive the code in two different directions, resulting in a big mess. Not the best outcome. When you hear the coffee mug ringing, it’s almost a blessing. You talk good-naturedly about how you would have done things if you could only speak to each other, but inside, you’re each plotting the other’s demise. After a bit of discussion from other pairs in the retrospective about how surprisingly well it went, this comes out. You’re worried for a second—have you made a nemesis?—but it actually helps a lot to understand what the other guy was thinking. Perhaps you’d better not pair again soon though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still don’t know his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session five. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/&quot;&gt;TDD as if you meant it.&lt;/a&gt;Simple, right? You pair with one of the guys you were talking to over lunch, who introduces himself as Raj. Nice bloke. Won’t stop smiling. You write your first test together, naturally trading ideas and the keyboard. It goes well, and you implement a solution together too, making sure to keep the method in the test class like the rules say. You don’t see the point of it. Then the man with the funny hair shows up and asks you about the second rule. You show him the implemention in the test class. He says that’s not good enough. You need to implement it in the test itself. It doesn’t make sense, but you do it anyway. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[Test]&lt;br/&gt;public void ALiveCellWithFewerThanTwoLiveNeighboursDies() {&lt;br/&gt;
    var cell = new Cell(Alive);&lt;br/&gt;
    cell.State = Dead;&lt;br/&gt;
    Assertion.AssertFalse(cell.IsAlive());&lt;br/&gt;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Now onto rule 5. “Where did &lt;code&gt;Cell&lt;/code&gt;come from? That’s not TDD.” Well, we needed a cell. “No you don’t. You can do it without the cell.” Huh? OK, you get rid of the cell class and replace it with just the state. You’re not really testing anything here. “Don’t worry, you will soon. And by the way, you probably don’t need that enum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you write another test, grumbling to Raj, who’s still smiling. You don’t like him so much any more. You write another test to check exactly the opposite. The funny-haired man swings back and says, “Good. You’ve got some duplication. Now refactor.” So you do. And suddenly, after pulling out a method, the test starts to read like a test again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about this afterwards, it’s clear that you can get pretty far without any classes at all. Whether you should is another matter, but it looks like a useful technique. Sans Mo talks about Test-Driven Design instead of Test-Driven Development, but he’s really just giving a name to the concepts being thrown out all around the table. It seems like it goes right against the ideas of Object Calisthenics, and this is confirmed by one of the guys standing up: it actually leads to a more functional design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final iteration of the day. Finally, some peace: this time, you do what you want. No &lt;del&gt;bastards&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;facilitators&lt;/ins&gt; wandering around and “helping”. You and your pair, Paulo, decide to just write some tests and see what happens, and you get pretty far. Annoyingly, you both see evidence of the rules cropping up in both your test and your code, especially object calisthenics. Your brain has decided that properties are a bad thing, and you feel a bit of anguish every time you write one. Your tests are angelic in their beauty, and you feel a pang of sadness as the coffee mug rings and your pair gently takes the laptop from you, almost callously hitting the &lt;em&gt;Delete &lt;/em&gt;key and vaporising your glorious creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You feel a tear running down your cheek, but not from sadness. You’ve finally realised that it’s not the destination that’s important, it’s the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a rather dramatised account of a fictional programmer who attended last Saturday’s Global Day of Coderetreat in London. The code and emotions are made up, but the events are real (except in the case of session four, where Olly and I were pretty close to smacking each other… though I did know his name). Thanks so much to everyone who came and specifically to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&quot;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; (the funny-haired man), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ollywickham&quot;&gt;Olly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marialacher&quot;&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt; for running the show and letting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; (the man without a moustache) pretend I was helping. Cheers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/valtech&quot;&gt;Valtech UK&lt;/a&gt; for providing us with a great space and delicious food. It was, by all accounts, a great success, and I’m looking forward to doing it again soon. And hopefully I’ll know what I’m doing next time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                        &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org&quot;&gt;Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. It was an event that took place all over the world on the same day. It&#039;s goal is to bring together developers and let them code together over one day without any job pressure.

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org&quot;&gt;Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. It was an event that took place all over the world on the same day. It&#039;s goal is to bring together developers and let them code together over one day without any job pressure. By pairing with foreign people that share the same interest, one can try new methods or learn the advantages and disadvantages of other programming languages or in general improve skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of the event are rather easy: Every round is 45 minutes long. After it there is a short retrospective/discussion what went well, what not. Then new constraints might be given (e.g. no use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_%28programming%29&quot;&gt;conditionals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(computing)&quot;&gt;loops&lt;/a&gt;), all code has to be deleted and with a new partner all starts again from the beginning. During the timespan of these 45 minutes one tries to implement &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&quot;&gt;Conways Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on four simple rules but not possible to be done right in this timeframe. The work is done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&quot;&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt;. This means that two people sit in front of a single computer and program/ try to solve the problem together. The overall goal is not a full implementation but the learning process - the way is the goal, so to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine told me about this day and after some searching I found out that there is also one &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.cz/&quot;&gt;event taking place in Prague&lt;/a&gt;. Since my Czech language skills are not good yet (I currently do an exchange semester), I asked (via Twitter) if I still can come. The organizators agreed and so I registered for one of the 50 available slots. It ended up with all places taken and was a great experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started early in the morning. I had to catch the tram at 7:13 o&#039;clock to be at &lt;a href=&quot;http://prague.the-hub.net/&quot;&gt;The Hub&lt;/a&gt; (close to Anděl) at 8:00. When I arrived there around 10 minutes before eight, there were already circa 15 people standing in the small reception area. The old lady at the reception desk was not very happy about the fact that there was no space left and called the organizators who came down and lead us to the first floor. The Hub is a big Open Space office with many table groups, a chillout zone, a close conference room and an own bar. When I entered, I was really impressed about the friendliness and creativity this room radiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, I was the only non-czech and so every official announcement was done in Czech. In general I think that everyone of these guys (yes - no female developers at this event) could speak english - but the organizators and I agreed that it would be much more cozy when speaking their home language. Fortunately there was always someone who was kind enough to translate at least the important things for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short introduction talk, we already started the first round (of six in total). Everyone took a free chair at one of the many tables, so we stayed in this constellation for the first round to form the pairs. I sat together with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; developer who is currently involved in the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_application&quot;&gt;iPhone applications&lt;/a&gt;. Since he never saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; before, we agreed to implement the first round in this programming language on my computer. He had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Unibody&quot;&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; (so he would have had also Python installed) but no &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment&quot;&gt;IDE&lt;/a&gt; for it. We did it in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt; style and he was possitively surprised - even if I had some problems at the beginning remembering some of Pythons syntax... We had some interesting conversations about how we should takle the problem but agreed in the end to use a 2-dimensional array of booleans to represent the cells on the game&#039;s grid (with _true_ meaning that the cell is alive). Btw. I really like the feature of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pydev.org/&quot;&gt;PyDev&lt;/a&gt; to let the unit tests run after saving any of the files in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second round I paired with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt; guy. He implemented the game in the first game with his collegue in C# and &lt;em&gt;without any tests&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, he never had experienced TDD. Since he was curious how Python works, I did another round in this programming language. When we were discussing how to implement the grid, he had had a complete different idea: His approach was to store only the alive cells in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashmap&quot;&gt;hashmap&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the grid could be extended infinitely. Unfortunately we did not reach the implementation phase of the alive calculation due to time reasons. He wanted to do this with the help keys of the hashmap. It seemed like a hack to me and I am still curious how he would have implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed again my partner. Again a Mac user and also interested to see the solution in Python. But I also wanted to see some new language and so we agreed to do it this time in C# (by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29&quot;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;). Until now C# was for me only &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; with other keywords (using vs. import etc.). But I realized that C# has inherited many features from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; as well. That was interesting for me. We did the development in a test-driven manner, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nunit.org/&quot;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; runner took always around 10 seconds to start, even where we just had 4 files... This time we used an two dimensional array that we filled with instances of a cell class. This was done only if the cell was alive. Otherwise the array slot was &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, because we had talked about saving &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt; space before. I am not sure if this reduced the used RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three rounds we made a lunch break. The organizators had ordered so many thai food, pizzas and burgers that also the double amount of people would have got full with it. I grabbed a burger and talked to my last programming partner over the break. He was also a student and in his first semester of studying to become a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSc.&quot;&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering&quot;&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. We had a really great discussion about the sense of TDD and he told me that in his last internship he had to work with an application with over 100&#039;000 lines of code without a single test. His argument was that &quot;there was no time for writing them&quot;. I asked him if he never had lectures or seminars addressing testing in his bachelor studies (also in software engineering) and he told me that he never had to write any tests. That had a deep impression on me - I mean who if not software engineering and computer science students should learn something about TDD? I recommended to him to read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321146530&quot;&gt;book of Kent Beck&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201485672&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Refactoring book of Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131177052&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;book of Michael Feathers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for a fourth round. The organizators proposed that we should try to keep our methods under 5 lines long and the classes small with also a maximum of 3-5 methods. But it ended up being again Python, again using an array of bool values, again explaining TDD. Since this was already a lot, we ignored the &quot;keep things small&quot; proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fifth round the organizers proposed to use no conditionals and no loops to solve the problem. I paired with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; developer who was interested in Python - but we both were tired using our &quot;favorite&quot; language at this day and none of us had done a full implementation of all rules yet. Thus, we decided to use Java and to try to implement with minimal tests as much as we can in the given time period. When we explained this to one of the facilitators (the organizers walked around like coaches) he was a little bit...disappointed...but agreed since our goal was still to use another language and to train our skills. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org/profiles/blogs/coderetreat-2011-in-prague&quot;&gt;One group&lt;/a&gt; downloaded Google&#039;s new language &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; and tried to work with this, to check out this new language and to test it as an alternative for their current used ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the short retrospective meeting, I changed my partner for the last time on this day. The organizers suggested to &quot;do something crazy&quot;, e.g. writing the program without tests (what some people already did the whole time). I paired with a Java developer and we played &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/ping-pong&quot;&gt;Ping Pong&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (Person A only writes tests, Person B only production code) in combination with &quot;Find The Loophole&quot; (in which the the coder purposefully tries to write the wrong algorithm while passing all tests). Especially the second approach is very interesting when you realize how much (or better less) code is needed to fulfill your nice test case - without implementing any &quot;real&quot; business logic. First I was the test writer but we switched the roles in the middle of the time and both of us really enjoyed this session (or maybe just being a little bit &quot;iniquitous&quot; to the other guy). Also I again realized how much I dislike that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/&quot;&gt;Jetbrains&lt;/a&gt; (btw. a czech company!) editors, in this case &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;, do not have strict line endings. I mean, you can always press the key-combination to reformat your code properly, but still it is kind of weird...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this sixth round (around 17:30 o&#039;clock), we reached the end of the total coding session and came all together to do a retrospective before everyone went home (or to a pub). The questions every attendee had to answer were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, did you learn today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, surprised you today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, will you do differently in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Overall I really enjoyed this event and look forward to attend also in the next year if possible. Many thanks to the people who organized and guided the event as well as the sponsors that made this great experience possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;It was 3:30pm on Friday afternoon, and I was heading out of work for my daily drive back home. I slipped behind the wheel of my car, turned the key, put the car into gear, and then...sat there.  Because it wasn&#039;t just any Friday. In just a few hours, the first Coderetreats of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalday.coderetreat.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt; would start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could start my drive, I thought about what was going to happen. At about 5:00pm my time on Friday, or about 10:00pm UTC, the first coderetreats of 90+ were going to start in Australia, and lives would start to be changed.  The event would then follow the sun and march around the world, leaving a wake of changed developers behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about the incredible amount of work that was done by many people to make the Global Day of Coderetreat a reality. Hosts and facilitators all around the world had been working hard for the last three months getting ready. Local organizers ran long and challenging marketing campaigns to get people to come out and participate. Sometimes, the entire global community would &quot;swarm&quot; a single location to help raise sign-up numbers. Experienced facilitators trained new facilitators. SWAG was explored, evaluated, and debated. Sponsors were found. Stickers were printed and mailed. Websites were launched. New applications were hastily written and pressed into service. Interviews were recorded and published. Emails were sent. Tweets were broadcast (and re-broadcasted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the global effort to make Saturday, December 3rd special was very large and incredibly inspirational. I couldn&#039;t &quot;just drive&quot; like I did on every other day. I found myself needing a few moments to reflect on what was accomplished and what would be accomplished in the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I did take my foot off the brake and put it onto the gas. Eventually, I did drive home. But during the entire one-hour drive, I found myself thinking and reflecting on what an amazing community of developers we have. Not just locally, but globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had trouble focusing on anything else for the rest of the evening. My wife threatened to take away my phone as I eagerly read tweets and emails about the early hours of the global event.  Some of us ended up on IRC. Eventually, Corey Haines took a moment from facilitating to jump on IRC and tell us all to go to bed.  After all, we were going to be hosting and facilitating our own coderetreats (I&#039;ll write more on Pittsburgh&#039;s amazing day later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, those few hours leading up to the start of Global Day of Coderetreat were special.  I&#039;ll never forget what it felt like to reflect on what so many had worked for.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Coderetreat events are easy to organize, only requiring enough sponsorship for venue and lunch. It is easy to find a sponsor in cities with strong company presence, but there are a lot of places that don&#039;t necessarily have this. Unfortunately, this can be a detriment to running coderetreats and other community-focused, practice-oriented events. To this end, we are establishing the Coderetreat Community Contribution Fund, the c3f, currently operating as a non-profit and under review for 501(c)(3) status. The c3f is currently being formed to subsidize and support local coderetreat events in areas without a strong company sponsorship presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before too long, basic programming skills and understanding are going to be as important as basic literacy; in fact, they are going to be an essential part of it. Unfortunately, the state of kids programming instruction is fragmented. There are a lot of fantastic programs running, such as KidsRuby, Hackety-Hack, Jason Gorman&#039;s Developer-Teacher matchups and Stephen Howell&#039;s work with Scratch, but these programs are all running in isolation. There are also a lot of initiatives in Academia, most of which have no idea about the industry programs. By bringing them together and focusing on our common goals, though, we can support each other and make a much larger impact. To this end, the long-term mission of the coderetreat community contribution fund is to help bridge the communication and support for these otherwise isolated programs. By creating a centralized organization, we also provide a beacon for large-scale support. The goal is to generate larger donations from both industry and academia that can then be used to effectively push the kids programming activities forward in a concerted way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just in the early planning stages of the organization, and more information will be coming over the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
