SUMMARY:Facilitator training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!   This training is for facilitators. Any
 body interested in facilitating a coderetreat is invited to attend at 
 least one training session. This training will be delivered online on 
 Google Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes before
  the training starts.\nThis year we will have several types of trainin
 gs for Global Day of Coderetreat hosts and facilitators.\nThe job of t
 he host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure e
 verything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equip
 ment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end
  of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.\nThe job 
 of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Faci
 litators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain the con
 straints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day\nÂ \nIm
