SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 - Mogilev, Belarus
DESCRIPTION:Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focus
 ing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providi
 ng developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away f
 rom the pressures of 'getting things done', the code retreat format ha
 s proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. P
 racticing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, 
 developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the 
 cost of change over time.   More specifically,  individuals are are 
 grouped into teams of two and each team “solves” a common problem,
  ‘The Game of Life’.  There are 6 sessions throughout the day and
  for each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted.  A
 fter each session there are session reflections to help with the  int
 ernalization of lessons. \nPlease join us for a full day of hands-on 
 coding practice to improve your craft.\n\nFor more information visit h
