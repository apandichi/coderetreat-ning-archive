SUMMARY:First Balkan coderetreat, Sofia, Bulgaria
DESCRIPTION:Stefan Kanev had the idea to organize a coderetreat where 
 people from the countries neighbouring Bulgaria could attend. It's not
  just about passionate people honing their craft, but also about passi
 onate people travelling from other countries to Sofia for one day of m
 agnificence.  Here is the link where you can register: http://balkan-c
 oderetreat.com/  If this event goes well we want to start organizing i
 t in different countries in the Balkans, one every couple of months.  
 If you have any questions or just want to get in touch, please email u
 s at questions@balkan-coderetreat.com.\n\nFor more information visit h
