SUMMARY:Coderetreat Belgium
DESCRIPTION:Based on all the feedback we got from our previous partici
 pants on the inquiry about the coderetreat we decided to run the first
  experiment during the next coderetreat on 20 April.\nWe have changed 
 the problem/algorithm. We will no longer tackle Conway's game of life,
  for this edition we will use the popular poker game to practice with 
 and experiment on. We are also looking into other coding katas for the
  next sessions.\nWe are also proud to announce that Adi will be co-fac
 ilitating this one again. And there will be some changes in how the fa
 cilitation is done, come over and experience it first hand.\nhttp://co
