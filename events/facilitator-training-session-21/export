 angouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes before the training
  starts.\nLike last year we will have two different types of trainings
  for Global Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.\nThe j

  sure everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessar
 y equipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at 
 the end of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.\nT
 he job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each othe
 r. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain 
 the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day\
