SUMMARY:Coderetreat: Java 8 vs Scala
DESCRIPTION:This event is fully devoted to the upcomingÂ Java 8, its f
 eatures, and how it allÂ stacks up against alternative languages likeÂ
  Scala. We are going to present what's new and what's different. After
  that we'll pull an extended, focused coding session coderetreat-style
 .\nThe coding session has three parts:\n- BuildingÂ a thingÂ in Java w
 ith the common pre-8 approach.Â - Redoing it with Java 8 features (â€œ
 how is 8 different?â€).Â - Redoing it with Scala (â€œhow is Scala dif
 ferent?â€).\nDiscussion of all three approaches will follow.\nPro-tip
 s and considerations:\n- You should bring your own laptop, or share wi
 th a friend.Â - It's better to work in pairs.Â - We'll help you set up
  JDK 8, but you should know what a JDK is.Â - We'll raffle out oneÂ In
 telliJ IDEAÂ license at the end of event.\n\nFor more information visi
