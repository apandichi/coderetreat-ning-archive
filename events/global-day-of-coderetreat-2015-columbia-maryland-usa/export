 5757/\nCode Retreat is a day long fun way to improve your software cra
 ftsmanship in one day intensive with hands on Test Driven Development 
 like you really mean it. You'll experiment with writing software in wa
 ys you never have before. You'll learn something new from each new pai
 r partner you work with.Code Retreat focuses on the fundamentals of so
 ftware development and design.\nBy providing developers the opportunit
 y to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'gettin
 g things done', the Code Retreat format has proven itself to be a high
 ly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principl
 es of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their
  ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.\nM
 ore specifically, individuals are are grouped into teams of two and ea
 ch team “solves” a common problem, ‘The Game of Life’. There a
 re multiple short sessions throughout the day and for each session the
  groups are reorganized. After each session there are session reflecti
 ons to help with the internalization of lessons.\nAnd breakfast and lu
 nch and snacks are provided.\n\nFor more information visit http://code
