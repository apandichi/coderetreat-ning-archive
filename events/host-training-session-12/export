SUMMARY:Host training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n This training is for hosts. If you hos
 t a Coderetreat you might be interested in attending one training sess
 ion. The trainers will explain what is the role of the host, tips and 
 tricks for having an excellent coderetreat day. This training will be 
 delivered online on Google Plus Events. Make sure you will be online f
 ive minutes before the training starts.\n\nLike last year we will have
  two different types of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for h
 osts and for facilitators.\n\nThe job of the host is to make sure the 
 coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts
  find a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to spon
 sor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video 
 chats with other locations, etc.\n\nThe job of the facilitator is to h
 elp participants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the co
 deretreat format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep 
 a learning atmosphere during the day\n\nImportant: All the times are i
