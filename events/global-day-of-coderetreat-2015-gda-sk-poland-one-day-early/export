SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2015 (one day earlier) - Gdańsk, Po
 land
DESCRIPTION:Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focus
 ing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providi
 ng developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away f
 rom the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has
  proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Pr
 acticing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, d
 evelopers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the c
 ost of change over time.\n\nWe scheduled four different session during
  which we will be practicing coding in: Java, Scala, Go, PHP, Python\n
 Session #1\n\nno constraints, master the game\n\nSession #2 (choose as
  many constraints as you want)\n\npolymorphism rather thean boolean fl
 ags\nno loops\nno if statements\nfunctional style\nsmall methods (<5 l
 ines, 1 line?)\nno language primitives\nTDD As If You Meant It\n\nSess
 ion #3\n\nsilence, no talks, just code\n\nSession #4\n\n(try) not to u
 se mouse\n\n\nFor more information visit http://coderetreat.org/events
