SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Austin, TX, USA
DESCRIPTION:Agile Velocity will be hosting a Coderetreat in Austin as 
 others around the world do the same on the Global Day of Coderetreat (
 http://gdcr.coderetreat.org) on Saturday, November 15, 2014. Come join
  us at the Agile Velocity offices from 8am-5pm for a day of practicing
  the craft of programming.\n \nCoderetreat is a day-long, intensive p
 ractice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development an
 d design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focu
 sed practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the co
 deretreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of s
 kill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and objec
 t-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code 
 that minimizes the cost of change over time. You can find out more abo
 ut Coderetreat at http://coderetreat.org.\n \nAll skill levels are we
 lcome, and everyone will learn something new about programming. You wi
 ll need a laptop (ready to use a programming language you are comforta
 ble with) and a willingness to pair program with others and have fun. 
 We will work together to explore a programming problem throughout the 
 day in a series of 45 minutes sessions with discussions.\n Food and dr
 ink will be provided for both breakfast and lunch. If you will attend,
  please register at the Eventbrite link below to help us ensure we hav
 e food (and room) for everyone.\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-d
