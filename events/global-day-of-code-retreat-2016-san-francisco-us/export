DESCRIPTION:Registration: https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Softwar
 e-Craftsmanship/events/234610700/\n\nGlobal Day of Code Retreat is an 
 annual event where craftspeople from all around the world gather toget
 her to practice their craft. Last year the event attracted over 2000 d
 evelopers from around 150 cities around the globe. In 2016 the event w
 ill happen on October 22nd. We will start at 8.30 AM and conclude by 5
  PM, of course with the option to end the day with a few drinks. So br
 ing your own laptops, configured with your favorite IDEs and programmi
 ng languages and come join us for a full day of practice, learning and
  fun. Light breakfasts, lunch and refreshments will be provided.\n\nFo
 r those of you who are not familiar with code retreats, I copied below
  some of the information from coderetreat.org.\n\nA Code Retreat is a 
 day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of so
 ftware development and design.\n\nBy providing developers the opportun
 ity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'gett
 ing things done', the code retreat format has proven itself to be a hi
 ghly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic princi
 ples of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve the
 ir ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.\
 n\nA code retreat has an established, time-tested format that is optim
 ized for focused practice.\n\nStructure:\nLength of Session: 45 minute
 s\nDuration: 8.30am to 5 or 6pm\nPair-programming is necessary, as the
  knowledge transfer contained in that activity is essential to the pra
 ctice\nPrefer using Test-Driven Development (TDD)\nAfter each session,
  pairs should be swapped\nAfter each session, code must be deleted, no
 t put in a branch, not stashed, just deleted with no trace left\n\nThe
  code retreat day consists of 5-6 sessions, each session's learnings b
 uilding upon previous sessions. The morning focuses on becoming comfor
 table with the problem domain, breaking old habits and beginning focus
 ed self-discovery. The afternoon pushes the envelope by challenging pa
 irs to stretch their skills and understanding of abstractions, modular
  design and test-driven development.\n\nMore information\n\nVideo expl
