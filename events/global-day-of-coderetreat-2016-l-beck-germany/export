SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - LÃ¼beck, Germany
DESCRIPTION:We will celebrate the Global Day of Code Retreat in LÃ¼bec
 k!\nDuring normal work we donÂ´t have much time to work on our core sk
 ills as developer. Under time pressure we often use known technics or 
 habits although we know that there are better ways.\nAs well as an art
 ist we need to have a place where we can practice our skills and thatÂ
 ´s what is a code retreat about.\nIn small sessions we work in pairs s
 o solve a small given problem... the whole day. ItÂ´s not about being 
 finished, itÂ´s about learning, making errors, trying new ways and hav
 ing a lot of fun.\nPlease bring a laptop with your favorite IDE with y
 ou so that we can start in time. Lunch, drinks and food is provided by
  DrÃ¤ger as well as the cozy athmosphere in their innovation garage.\n
 Afterwards we can have some beers in a pub.\n\nFor more information vi
