 Make sure you will be online five minutes before the training starts. 
  Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for Glob
 al Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.  The job of the
  host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure eve
 rything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equipme
 nt, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end o
 f the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.  The job of
  the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Facili
 tators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain the const
 raints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.\n\nFor m
