SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:This training is for facilitators. Anybody interested in f
 acilitating a Coderetreat is invited to attend at least one training s
 ession. This training will be delivered on-line on Google Plus Events.
  Make sure you will be on-line five minutes before the training starts
 .  Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for G
 lobal Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.    The job 
 of the host is to make sure the Coderetreat runs smoothly by making su
 re everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary e
 quipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the
  end of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.    T
 he job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each othe
 r. Facilitators understand the Coderetreat format, choose and explain 
 the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.
