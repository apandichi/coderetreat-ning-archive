SUMMARY:Global Day of Code Retreat 2011 - Durban, South Africa
DESCRIPTION:Global Day of Coderetreat is a world-wide event celebrati
 ng passion and software craftsmanship. We will spend the day practicin
 g the craft of software development using the coderetreat format.\nCod
 eretreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fund
 amentals of software development and design. By providing developers t
 he opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressur
 es of ‘getting things done’, the coderetreat format has proven its
 elf to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing th
 e basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers c
 an improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of chan
 ge over time.\nThis is a language-agnostic event. Each session, the pa
 ir chooses what language they want to work in. So, no matter what your
  language of choice, you are welcome. We practice the fundamentals: T
 DD and the 4 rules of simple design ; these are applicable regardle
 ss of language.\n \nThe idea of day long practice sessions for progra
 mmers was formalized by Corey Haines.\nRead more on his blog about H
 ow does Code Retreat work?\n\nDetails:\n\nWe start at 9am with a Skype
  call to Kent Beck for a few minutes so please come a little earlier a
 t 8:45am.\nWe will finish around 5pm\nBring your own laptop*\nOur spon
 sors provide coffee and snacks + lunch!\nYou should know theory of TDD
 , Clean Code, refactoring and be ready to practice.\n\n* Laptop should
  be ready for development, with everything You need installed (IDE, un
 it testing framework). Consider bringing external keyboard.\nWe practi
 ce, by working on Game of Life problem. Our goal is not to implement
  a complete solution for this game, but rather to focus on some aspect
  of our craft (simple names, removing duplication etc).\nHashtag: #gd
