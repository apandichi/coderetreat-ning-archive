SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2014 - Athens, GA, USA
DESCRIPTION:Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focus
 ing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providi
 ng developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away f
 rom the pressures of 'getting things done', the code retreat format ha
 s proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. P
 racticing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, 
 developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the 
 cost of change over time.¬†More specifically, ¬†individuals are are gr
 ouped into teams of two and each team ‚Äúsolves‚Äù a common problem, ‚
 ÄòThe Game of Life‚Äô. ¬†There are 6 sessions throughout the day and f
 or each session the groups are reorganized and the code deleted. ¬†Aft
 er each session there are session reflections to help with the ¬†inter
 nalization of lessons.¬†Snacks and lunches will be provided and it is 
 guaranteed to be something other than pizza. ¬†Sorry pizza lovers :)Fo
