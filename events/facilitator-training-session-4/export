SUMMARY:[Cancelled] Facilitator Training Session

  Google Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes befor
 e the training starts.\nThis year we will have several types of traini
 ngs for Global Day of Coderetreat hosts and facilitators.\nThe job of 
 the host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure 
 everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equi
 pment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the en
 d of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.\nThe job
  of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Fac
 ilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain the co
 nstraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day\nÂ \nI
