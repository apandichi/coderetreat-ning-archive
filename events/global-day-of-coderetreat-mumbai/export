SUMMARY:Global Day of CodeRetreat, Mumbai
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a day writing code just for the love of writing it
  beautifully! A day without the office pressures of \"getting things 
 done\"; a day just focused on practicing the art of writing clean, lea
 n, modular and test driven code. \nWelcome to the Global Day of CodeR
 etreat, an annual global event where passionate programmers come toget
 her to hone their skills. Red Panda is proud to host the Mumbai chapte
 r of GDCR 2016 on October 22, 2016. \nThis link gives an idea of wha
 t a typical Coderetreat Day looks like, and we will be following a sim
 ilar structure on the day.\n• Bring your laptop with your favourite
  language and IDE installed.\n• Code in any language of your choi
 ce.\n• We will be taking care of lunch and evening snacks. \n\nWhy
  should I attend CodeRetreat?\nCoderetreat gets you away from the ever
 yday environment where you normally work. This allows you to focus on 
 deliberate learning. While you may certainly learn and practice ways o
 f improving in your normal work, Coderetreat allows you to improve, le
 arn, practice & master:\n ● Pair programming (Driver <--> Navigator
  technique)\n ● TDD (Ping <--> Pong technique)\n● How to write cl
 ean code \n● Refactoring \n● Do things differently \n● Solid 
 Principles \n● DRY Principles \n● KISS Priniciples \n● Diffe
 rent 'Design Patterns' techniques\n\nOur awesome facilitator for the e
 vent:\nPiyush, our Technical Architect with over 8 years of experience
  developing clean code and crafting great software.\n\nShoot at us any
  questions you may have. Feel free to share the event link on Facebook
 . We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFor more information visit h
