 e last year we will have two different types of trainings for Global D
 ay of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.   The job of the h
 ost is to make sure the Coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure every
 thing is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equipment
 , find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of 
 the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.   The job of
  the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Facili
 tators understand the Coderetreat format, choose and explain the const
 raints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.  Find yo
