  coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Host
 s find a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to spo
 nsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video
  chats with other locations, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to he
 lp participants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the cod
 eretreat format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep a
  learning atmosphere during the day.\n\nFor more information visit htt
