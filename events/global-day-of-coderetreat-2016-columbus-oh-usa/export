SUMMARY:Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 - Columbus, OH, USA
DESCRIPTION:\nA Coderetreat is an intensive practice event, focusing o
 n the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing de
 velopers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from t
 he pressures of \"getting things done\", the code retreat format has p
 roven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement.\nThe
  Global Day of Coderetreat is a specially yearly event where people fr
 om across the global all participate in a Coderetreat. This year’s 
 event for Columbus will be hosted as part of Columbus Code Camp so sig
 n up there if you'd like to attend.\nSo what should you expect at a Co
 deretreat? You should expect to code. Individuals are grouped into tea
 ms of two or three and each team works toward a solution to a common p
 roblem, in this case Conway’s Game of Life. Each session lasts abou
 t an hour and there are several sessions over the course of the day. A
 t the end of each session, code is deleted, groups are shuffled, and 
 there is a retrospective to reflect upon and share what was learned.
