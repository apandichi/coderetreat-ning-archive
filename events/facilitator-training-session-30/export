SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:This training session will be held by Matt Plavcan\nPlease
  RSVP here!\nThis training is for facilitators. Anybody interested in 
 facilitating a Coderetreat is invited to attend at least one training 
 session. This training will be delivered online on Google Plus Events.
  Make sure you will be online five minutes before the training starts.
    Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for G
 lobal Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.   The job o
 f the host is to make sure the Coderetreat runs smoothly by making sur
 e everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary eq
 uipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the 
 end of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.   The
  job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other.
  Facilitators understand the Coderetreat format, choose and explain th
 e constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day.\n
