SUMMARY:Host training session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\nThis training is for hosts. If you host
  a coderetreat you might be interested in attending one training sessi
 on. The trainers will explain what is the role of the host, tips and t
 ricks for having an excellent coderetreat day. This training will be d
 elivered online on Google Plus Events. Make sure you will be online fi
 ve minutes before the training starts.\nLike last year we will have tw
 o different types of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for host
 s and for facilitators.\nThe job of the host is to make sure the coder
 etreat runs smoothly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts find
  a venue with all the necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor l
 unch, give away the prizes at the end of the day, organize video chats
  with other locations, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to help par
 ticipants learn from each other. Facilitators understand the coderetre
 at format, choose and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learn
 ing atmosphere during the day\n\nImportant: All the times are in UTC.
