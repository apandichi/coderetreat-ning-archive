SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:This training is for facilitators. Anybody interested in f
 acilitating a Coderetreat is invited to attend at least one training s
 ession. This training will be delivered on-line on Google Plus Events.
  Make sure you will be on-line five minutes before the training starts
 .  Like last year we will have two different types of trainings for Gl
 obal Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for facilitators.  The job of t
 he host is to make sure the Coderetreat runs smoothly by making sure e
 verything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary equip
 ment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the end
  of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.  The job 
 of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. Faci
 litators understand the Coderetreat format, choose and explain the con
 straints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day. Find y
