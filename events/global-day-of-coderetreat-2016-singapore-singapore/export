 ing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providi
 ng developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away f
 rom the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has
  proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Pr
 acticing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, d
 evelopers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the c
 ost of change over time.\nHost: CJ from PayPal Facilitator:\n\nAbhaya
