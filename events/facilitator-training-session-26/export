SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here!\n \n\nThis training is for facilitators.
  Anybody interested in facilitating a coderetreat is invited to attend
  at least one training session. This training will be delivered online
  on Google Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes be
 fore the training starts.\nLike last year we will have two different t
 ypes of trainings for Global Day of Coderetreat: for hosts and for fac
 ilitators.\nThe job of the host is to make sure the coderetreat runs s
 moothly by making sure everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with
  all the necessary equipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give aw
 ay the prizes at the end of the day, organize video chats with other l
 ocations, etc.\nThe job of the facilitator is to help participants lea
 rn from each other. Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, ch
 oose and explain the constraints, and try to keep a learning atmospher
 e during the day\n\nImportant: All the times are in UTC. Do one of the
