SUMMARY:Facilitator Training Session
DESCRIPTION:Please RSVP here! \n\n\nThis training is for facilitators.
  Anybody interested in facilitating a coderetreat is invited to attend
  at least one training session. This training will be delivered online
  on Google Plus Hangouts. Make sure you will be online five minutes be
 fore the training starts.\nThis year we will have several types of tra
 inings for Global Day of Coderetreat hosts and facilitators.\nThe job 
 of the host is to make sure the coderetreat runs smoothly by making su
 re everything is arranged. Hosts find a venue with all the necessary e
 quipment, find a company to sponsor lunch, give away the prizes at the
  end of the day, organize video chats with other locations, etc.\nThe 
 job of the facilitator is to help participants learn from each other. 
 Facilitators understand the coderetreat format, choose and explain the
  constraints, and try to keep a learning atmosphere during the day\nÂ
