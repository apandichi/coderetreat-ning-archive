Pairs change with every 45 minute iteration so everyone gets exposed to different problem solving strategies, and everyone learns together:  newbies and master-craft persons alike. There is no expectation to finish coding Conway's Game of Life at any point during the day. The purpose is to learn coding problem solving strategies, share skills and experience pairing in a supportive environment. <a href="http://www.pdxwit.org/">PDXWIT</a> a community-based non-profit organization with the purpose of strengthening the Portland women in tech community through educational programs, partnerships and events that provide information, connections, resources, opportunities, and a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower current women in tech and encourage others to pursue tech careers to help reduce gender imbalance in the industry and address the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.<a class="continue-link" href="http://coderetreat.org/xn/detail/6456126:Event:55409?xg_source=activity">See More</a></div></div></div>]]></description>
