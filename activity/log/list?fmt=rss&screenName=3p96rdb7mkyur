I've used a <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html" target="_blank">cross-timezone meeting planner</a> to determine times that work and have tentatively sent out invites to others for two hangouts; one just before our local lunchtime and another at our end-of-day retrospective. If you like the idea, it's not rocket science. You need to remain flexible, make sure you agree on the way to communicate beforehand, and then make sure to pay attention to the time to make it happen. It may even help to ask someone other that the event facilitator to do that. It's easy for a facilitator to have so many things going on that they miss the planned window.

For this exercise I ask everyone to agree on a single language, or choose from among two languages that everyone is OK with, and a single non-trivial kata, i.e. everyone solving the same problem. We also use cyber-dojo.org to level the playing field for all as regards an IDE.1. Start a timer after everyone has sorted themselves out (paired and begun). Set the timer for 10 minutes.2. At the end of ten minutes (remember, they were expecting to have 45 minutes), ask everyone to stand and each pair move together to the next station to their right. They are now taking over the other pair's code base.3. Start a timer, again for 10 minutes. At the end of ten minutes, repeat the instructions exactly; everyone rotates, moving with their original pair to the next workstation/laptop. -- Purpose: These two rotation obviously give participants a sense of what it means to take responsibility for a new-in-every-sense code base.4. Start a timer once again for 10 minutes. When it expires have everyone return to where they started. -- Purpose: This simulates the "What have they do to our/my code?"  5. As timer expires, have just 1 member of each pair move to any workstation/laptop where they have not been previously.-- Purpose: This simulates having to explain to a new team member how everything works, even when not all of the code is yours, sort of a joint discovery, complete with some exposed vulnerability.I've used variations of the above many times, and used it exactly as described just last weekend. The retrospective revealed exactly what you would expect: the long-time developers and consultants totally got it. The newer folks had their eyes forced wide open. Craftsmanship isn't all unicorns and rainbows.<a class="continue-link" href="http://coderetreat.org/profiles/blogs/three-simulations-in-one-45-min-sprint">See More</a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

The stated goals of the exercise are to create a micro-service based calculator, a patently absurd goal. The real purpose of the exercise is the allow the attendees to learn for themselves how to self organize, providing only as much guidance as proves necessary. The results are described below the handout.&lt;begin handout&gt; Welcome to ICC, Incremental Calculator Corp. Today you are going to build the first ever micro-service based massively scalable calculator.Features - in value rank order:Add two positive integers in the range 0 to 10^6 and show the result (rudimentary addition function). Add two opposite signed integer numbers and show the result (rudimentary subtraction function). Add two fractional numbers and show the result (full addition and subtraction function, range 10 to minus 6th, to 10 to the 6th)  Multiply one number by another and show the result. Divide one number by another and show the result. Bonus: Provide the ability to perform all of the above operations when entering and displaying hexadecimal numbers. Constraints – ICC’s CEO recently subscribed to a trade journal and has been reading up on all the latest trends. As a result, he has mandated the following constraints: The calculator will be built using the latest Web based client-server architecture.  The calculator must have separated display and data entry means (i.e. the ability to enter numbers and operators must reside on a different computer than the computer that manages the display).  Entering a number or operator must inform the display of what’s been entered via a RESTful interface and the display must confirm the receipt of anything it is asked to display. Definition-of-done for each feature after the first sprint must include unit tests and Behavior Driven Development tests running green. The tests must assert expected behavior for both success conditions as well as failure handling. Bonuses are offered for each of the following:The first working demoThe second working demoThe most demos that are acceptedThe most complete implementationThe “rules” are described as follows:We will work together for 45 minute sprints, and then do an open retro (everyone together).Beyond that, there are no rules.  Vote with your feet. If you feel you are neither contributing nor getting value, then by all means find another team (table) to work with.&lt;end of handout&gt;What I intentionally did not do was give specific direction on how the teams should be organized, formed, or anything else that self-organizing teams should figure out for themselves. I was richly rewarded by the results.The "Bonuses" were a deliberate attempt to lure the teams into competition vs. collaboration.Results from 4/11/15 workshop:  Sprint #1: By the end of the sprint (45 minutes) the attendeeshad figured out that they need not compete, but would benefit from collaborating and dividing their effort along different types of work; e.g. server-side vs. client-side. they had a working github repo, had agreed on an architecture, andrealized they needed to stand up a server, and were working on it.In sprint one's retro it was brought out that a lot of time was spent getting everyone to the same place in terms of MVP. For instance a lot of time was wasted trying to work out session management to accommodate multiple clients. YAGNI.What they ultimately did not do (yet) was show any working code. The reason offered was that the other parts they were reliant on were not ready yet. It was pointed out that each team mocking the part they were dependent on from another team would have allowed some/all to show demonstrable progress.Quotable moment: One participant observed that in a single 45 minute period they have accomplished what large companies are often unable to do after a months time. Sprint #2: By the end of the sprint the attendees …Showed a working server.Two teams had a working testing framework and at least one working test.They had started merging work into the repo.Some struggling with github and git was observed. Made it clear participants must reach out when they are stuck. We talked about time-boxing a problem to prevent it’s becoming a sinkhole.Advised teams that they needed to be planning for integration by actually talking across teams. All communication after they split up into teams had been entirely intra-team. Lunch was used as an opportunity to bridge the gaps between teams.==== Lunch ===  Sprint #3: Breakthrough – some exchange of APIs and subsequent learning and adjustments. Also demo-able code (a single operator button and two input fields) worked locally but did not have a working network connection feature yet.Also saw some learning about the mechanics of sharing a repo among teams, e.g. jars that were unfit on any system other than where they were created.Pull requests were offered as one method for managing the repo, along with much more inter-team communication in general. Agreeing on conventions/policies for what constituted acceptable packaging for a pull-request was discussed.Notable learning: Using a virtual card wall (Trello) was attempted, to manage the work and to report bugs. What actually happened when a “bug” was reported (verbally): the participants instead walked over and talked to one another and quickly eliminated the problem. No problem remained to track. This resulted in a retro discussion about the priority of “bugs”.Sprint #4: Big jump in demo-able code – all four operators worked locally, on the client; only one operation was wired up to invoke the server connection. The communication succeeded at a network layer but apparently not at the application layer. An unexpected reply was received.All four operations passed local BDD function tests on the server. Problems with round pegs and square holes persisted in the exchange of code. More getting up and moving to another table to talk other teams, was reiterated as not only allowable but highly desired.Sprint #5:  Getting closer, and cross team communication is now common. Network communication is working a now the server code returns http response codes as well as messages to indicate results or complain about what’s wrong.Sprint #6:  It’s 5:10 (we started at 8am) and I can’t get these people to leave; they really want to show results (which was never the objective). I’m feeling very good about how the day went. The participants seem to share that feeling.Permissions: If you feel any of the above has value for your training/workshops, please feel free to copy all or any part. I would ask only hat you give attribution and reference this post.Thank you, Bob Allen<a class="continue-link" href="http://coderetreat.org/profiles/blogs/self-organizing-team-s-exercise">See More</a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

A second handout was given just after lunch. Together they define an exercise designed to require teams to work out and demonstrate these skills:Self organization of teams when given full reign (and full responsibility).How to work with what you're given, even when extremely sparse.How to deliver iteratively (MVP).How to keep parts of the solution decoupled from one another.&lt;Handout #1 - Morning session&gt;Welcome to the BBC - Part IWelcome to the BBC - The “Bouncy Ball Company”. You have been selected to join the newly formed Super Hot Automation Facilitation Team, SHAFT for short.The focus of this team is to outcompete every other manufacturer by building software that will automate every step in the manufacture of most any sort of ball, starting with the most popular product here in the northeast; the football (American NFL football).Manufacturing overview reference: <a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Football.html">http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Football.html</a>For the bill of materials and manufacturing steps, see the link above:Forms teams, possibly based on the stages of the manufacturing process, and be sure to remain agile. More news later.The first half of the day (pre-lunch) will be devoted to iterating and improving the process with at least three deliveries, each accompanied by a customer review and feedback.&lt;end Handout #1 - Morning session&gt;LUNCH&lt;Handout #2 - Afternoon session&gt;Welcome to the BBC - Part IIStart manufacturing soccer balls. The requirement is to apply all the learning that went into making footballs to now making soccer balls, maximizing the automation by maximizing parameterization, and minimizing waste of the raw materials.Manufacturing overview reference: <a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Soccer-Ball.html">http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Soccer-Ball.html</a>As you may have surmised by now, the real exercise is about teamwork, both within teams and across teams, and rapidly finding out what works for the people who show up.&lt;end Handout #2 - Afternoon session&gt;Here's what happened:The morning was predictably defined by lots of questions - -- What constitutes "acceptance"?. -- How will we divide the work up?" -- How will me track progress?The answers were much simpler than attendees imagined: -- Ask the customer what is acceptable, and a rank-ordered list of what comes first, second, etc. -- Organization is entirely up to the team(s). -- Deliver working (acceptable) software.The afternoon session raised the bar on agility at both the testing and implementation levels:Similarities: Both balls have an inner bladder, are inflated with a given quantity of air, required a valve to inflate the bladder, and require a stitched-together outer skin of n faces which has to be printed on (e.g. the logo, serial #, etc.)Differences: The specification (diameter, width, length, lacing or not, number of outer layer faces, shapes of the faces, number of different face shapes, weight, etc.) varied.The outcomes I was most pleased with were that 18 peoples who do not work together, all of who met at this monthly workshop ...collaborated rather than competing,natural leaders emerged quickly and at different points during the day,everyone participated and remained engaged for the entire day.<a class="continue-link" href="http://coderetreat.org/profiles/blogs/self-orgnizing-team-2-footballs">See More</a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>
