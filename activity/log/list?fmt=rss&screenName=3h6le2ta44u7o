Everyone has their IDEs and testing frameworks ready to go. You get to tackle the same problem multiple times. We had 7 blocks, each consisting of 45 minutes coding followed by 15 minutes retrospectives. In each coding phase you pair program with someone else. To spice things up, there’s a new constraint for each round, e.g. “No IF-statements allowed”. After each round you throw away the code. *gasp* Heresy!Why would you do a code retreat?For deliberate practice. There’s this famous analogy: Musicians spend a lot of time practicing, then give a few concerts. Software developers – who often build something they’ve never build before – spend all of their time “giving the concerts” and hardly ever just practice the basics, let alone with someone else. A code retreat is an opportunity to learnnew ways of thinking / approaching a task from your pairing partnerto take really small stepsnew languages (Code retreats are not language specific. I got to code in JavaScript, Java and Ruby. Java was the least common denominator – it works for everyone.)new shortcuts, IDEs, frameworks, …to throw away codeOur constraints for the 7 phases were:NonePing-Pong – A writes test, B writes code to pass test, B writes next test, A writes code to pass test, …Law of Demeter – No more than one “.” per expression allowed, so no objectFoo.getBar().doFoo() – Following this law leads to looser coupling<a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it">TDD as if you meant it</a>No naked primitives – No ints, no booleans, …No If – Yeah, that’s a hard one…Each pair could choose individually from a <a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog">long list</a> – We chose “Find the loophole”My takeaways:As I’m not a developer, I was afraid to slow my pairing partners down. No need to worry: Code retreat tasks, such as the classic <a href="http://coderetreat.org/gol">“Conway’s Game of Life”</a>, are quite simple and there were other non-developers attending. It’s helps if you’ve at least seen unit tests before, though.I take way too big stepsIn the “no primitives” round I learned to use enums instead of booleans and they make the code more “speaking”A code retreat is great fun, but also exhausting. 7 sessions is one too many.Next I’d like to attend a Legacy code retreat, where you learn to refactor old brittle code.Many thanks to the facilitators <a href="http://www.orchit.de/">Patrick Cornelißen</a> and <a href="http://shishkin.org/">Sergey Shishkin</a>, to <a href="http://www.innoq.com/de">innoQ</a> for hosting the event and to all attendees for making my first code retreat an awesome experience!So could be yours: <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events">Find a code retreat</a> near you!
