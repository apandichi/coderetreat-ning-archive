&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting idea. The difficulty, I would think, is that there would still be an original member of the pair. So, the assumptions and explanation of the code could be conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely try it. Before the session, though, explain what you&#039;ll be doing and really hit on the idea that this is about focusing on the understandability of the code. This will set people&#039;s expectations up-front, so there won&#039;t be too much jarring when you put them somewhere…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&#039;d push this as a penultimate session exercise, rather than in the morning. Later in the afternoon usually has pairs able to get past the inhibitions and assumptions of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d love to hear how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
