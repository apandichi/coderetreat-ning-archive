                        &lt;p&gt;I would say not strict at all if you make it free and you end up paying for the bill from your own pockets. Unless you can find sponsors that can pay for food and place. I would charge a small fee that covers the costs of the event. The point is not making money but paying for the expenses. Charging a fee also makes people show up. Although it is refundable for any reason they don&#039;t show. $20 is a fair charge. You gotta make the right math so you don&#039;t end up losing money though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2 coderetreats I have done attendants have told me to charge more. But I clarify that&#039;s not the point. The point is to bring people to learn and share not to make money. As long as I cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;                        </content>
